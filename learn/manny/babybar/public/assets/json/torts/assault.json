The plaintiff <b>perceived immediate physical contact</b> with the defendant, 2. Plaintiff had suspicion that he was <b>in imminent danger</b>. 3. The <b>actions</b> of the defendant, or tortfeasor, <b>were intentional</b>, not accidental. <br /><br />Assault is an <b>intentional tort</b> when one is placed in <b>reasonable apprehension</b> of an intentional, imminent, unconsented, harmful, or offensive touching by another person. Assaults occur when the targeted person's anxiety is the product of the actor's threatening conduct, such as stalking or placing a gun in front of one's face (loaded or not).

The mugger stood in front of her and shouted, \"Hand over your purse, or I'll beat you up!\" The mugger roughly snatched Jean's purse as she held it out to him.",
			"explanation": "Your Rule will come here<br /><br />An act is intentional if it is done purposely knowingly that the results will follow.<br /><br />Here mugger acted <b>intentionally</b> because mugger shouted at Jean to \"Hand over your purse, or I'll beat you up,\" his conduct was volitional and therefore intentional. Here mugger did <b>Overt Act</b> because he took substantial step in shouting over Jean. Here there is <b>Reasonable Apprehension</b> because mere words alone are not adequate to cause apprehension. The words \"hand over your purse or I'll beat you up\" coupled with the fact that he had the present ability to carry the threat out indicates the placing of another in reasonable apprehension. Here there is Apprehension of <b>Immediate Battery</b> because mugger shouted \"I'll beat you up\" i.e. act of causing battery. <br /><br />Therefore, Mugger is liable for assault."

However, an individual may physically invade the real property of another when it is reasonably and apparently necessary to avoid a threatened serious injury. When the invasion is solely for the benefit of a distinct person, the individual must pay for any actual damages.

Therefore, the question is whether the boater's actions are privileged by private necessity. Answers A, B, and C all address whether the boater was on notice that the property was private, which is irrelevant in a trespass action because the intent required is the intent to enter the land, not the intent to trespass.

He had a pair of shoes and a parka in the boat, but they were lost when the owner set it adrift. The boater was staying at a cabin one mile from the owner's property. The only land routes back were a short rocky trail that was dangerous during the storm, and a 15-mile road around the lake.

						"The boater knew that the property belonged to a private person.",
						"The boater had reasonable grounds to believe the property belonged to a private person.",
						"The boater had reasonable grounds to believe his boat might be swamped and sink."
					],
					"correct": 3,
					"explanation": "Answer D is correct. An individual will be liable for trespass when he intentionally physically invades the plaintiff's real property. However, an individual may physically invade the real property of another when it is reasonably and apparently necessary to avoid a threatened serious injury. When the invasion is solely for the benefit of a distinct person, the individual must pay for any actual damages. The privilege of necessity supersedes an individual's privilege to defend his property. Here, the boater intentionally physically invaded the owner's property. Therefore, the question is whether the boater's actions are privileged by private necessity. Answers A, B, and C all address whether the boater was on notice that the property was private, which is irrelevant in a trespass action because the intent required is the intent to enter the land, not the intent to trespass. Answer D addresses the proper issue: whether the boater reasonably believed that the invasion of the property was necessary. Therefore, D is correct while A, B, and C are incorrect."

Intent refers only to the intent to enter the land; the defendant need not know that the land belongs to the plaintiff. Therefore, if the defendant intentionally drove his car onto the plaintiff's land, this would provide a sufficient basis for a trespass claim.<br /> <br /> B is incorrect. Damage to the plaintiff's land by the defendant's property is not sufficient to sustain a claim of trespass because it does not establish intent of the part of the defendant. As with most other intentional torts, damage is presumed. Actual injury to the land is not an essential element of the cause of action. Likewise, damage and causation are insufficient to sustain a negligence claim without proof of duty and breach. Therefore, B does not provide a sufficient basis for a claim. Answer D is incorrect for the same reasons.<br /> <br /> C is incorrect. If the defendant negligently or unintentionally entered the land, the plaintiff would not have a trespass claim. Likewise, without damages there would be no valid negligence claim. Thus, C does not provide a sufficient basis for a claim of negligence or trespass."

Because the privilege is valid, the guard will be shielded from liability for the battery to the plaintiff through the doctrine of transferred privilege. Transferred privilege applies as a defense when, in the reasonable exercise of self-defense by the defendant, a third party is accidentally injured. A is not the best answer as it is an incorrect statement of the facts and a reference to criminal law. B is incorrect because although there was transferred intent, the guard's actions are protected by the privilege of self-defense. D is incorrect because the intent to shoot the robber would be transferred to the shooting of the plaintiff if not for the privilege of self-defense. Thus, A, B, and D are incorrect."

The tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress allows recovery for personal injury despite the absence of physical injury or touching of the plaintiff. The prima facie elements of a claim for the intentional infliction of emotional distress are (i) an act by the defendant constituting extreme and outrageous conduct, (ii) intent or recklessness by the defendant, (iii) causation, and (iv) damages amounting to severe emotional distress. On these facts, the neighbor was aware that his conduct would cause severe emotional distress, and he could be held liable for the man's emotional suffering, as well as for the value of the cat. Thus, Answer B is correct. <br /> <br /> Answer A is incorrect. The neighbor did not touch the man, so the neighbor is not liable for battery. There was an intentional touching, but the touching constituted only trespass to a chattel. <br /> <br /> Answer C is incorrect. Trespass to chattels provides an action for intentional interference with the plaintiff's chattel in a way that causes recognizable harm to the chattel, which was the case here. While the man could state a case of trespass to chattels, any recoverable damages would be limited to $25, the value of the cat. An action establishing intentional infliction of emotional distress would result in a larger recovery. <br /> <br /> Answer D is incorrect. Conversion provides a cause of action for interference with a chattel that is substantial enough to amount to the exercise of dominion or control.

Before the neighbor could restrain the dog, the dog managed to only bite the wife.<br /> <br /> If the husband asserts a claim based on assault against the neighbor, will he prevail?",
					"answerOptions": [
						"Yes, because the landowner did not have a privilege to use excessive force.",
						"Yes, because the husband reasonably believed that the dog might bite him.",
						"No, because the dog did not come in contact with him.",
						"No, because the neighbor was trying to protect his property."

					"correct": 1,
					"explanation": "B is correct. For the tort of assault, the husband's apprehension must be reasonable, and the neighbor must have the apparent present ability to complete the battery. The neighbor ran towards both the husband and the wife with the dog. Because husband reasonably believed that the dog would bite him, he will prevail in a claim for assault against the neighbor.<br /> <br /> A is not the best answer. Generally, a landowner can use reasonable force to prevent the commission of a tort against the property. However, the use of force must be preceded by a request to desist. Furthermore, the privilege of private necessity supersedes the defense of property privilege. Therefore, the landowner did not have the privilege to use any force, not just excessive force, and B is the better answer.<br /> <br /> C is incorrect because physical contact is not necessary for the commission of an assault. D is incorrect because the husband and wife's private necessity privilege supersedes the neighbor's defense of property privilege."

If the clerk had had such an intent, the lawyer's awareness that she was confined might have completed the prima facie case, but the clerk had no such intent."

An intentional tortfeasor is liable for all the consequences of his wrongful action, intended, unintended, or unforeseeable, including the negligent action of one who was affected by the wrongful act. The man is therefore entitled to an action in indemnity for the full amount of the judgment that he paid to the gang member.<br /> <br /> B is incorrect because contribution is the sharing of a financial burden among joint wrongdoers, and that is not the case in this situation. C is incorrect because as an intentional tortfeasor, the old friend will be liable for all of the consequences of his act. D is incorrect because the the friend's intentional tort renders the man's negligence irrelevant."

					"question": "The defendant hated his former wife for divorcing him and marrying another man a short time thereafter. About a month after his former wife remarried, the defendant secretly entered the couple's rented apartment during their absence by using a master key. The defendant placed a microphone behind the book stand in the bedroom of the apartment, drilled a hole in the nearby wall and poked the wires from the microphone through the hole into the space in the wall, with the result that the microphone appeared to be connected with wires going into the adjoining apartment. Actually the microphone was not connected to any thing. The defendant anticipated that his former wife would discover the microphone in a few days and would be upset by the thought that someone had been listening to her conversations with her new husband in their bedroom.<br /> <br /> Shortly thereafter, as he was putting a book on the stand, the new husband noticed the wires behind the book stand and discovered the hidden microphone. He then called his wife and showed her the microphone and wires. She fainted and, in falling, struck her head on the book stand and suffered a mild concussion. The next day the new husband telephoned the defendant and accused him of planting the microphone. The defendant laughingly admitted it. Because of his concern about his wife and his anger at the defendant, the new husband is emotionally upset and unable to go to work.<br /> <br /> If the defendant's former wife asserts a claim against the defendant based on infliction of mental distress, the fact that her current husband was the person who showed her the microphone will",

All of the stores are located on Main Street. There is one large gallery, Northwoods Gallery, at the north end of Main Street. At the south end of Main Street is the Snooze Inn, a large motel. Tourists often stay at the Snooze Inn when they want to spend more than a day in Craft Village. Craft Village shops, by town ordinance, must remain open from at least 10:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. every day, including Sundays. All of the shops close at 8:00 p.m. except Northwoods Gallery, which is open until 11:00 p.m. every night. Craft Village provides street lighting along Main Street, which is turned on each night at dusk.<br /><br />Jean arrived in Craft Village on Sunday night for her annual shopping expedition. As on all of her previous trips to Craft Village, she stayed at the Snooze Inn for two nights. She does not own a car, and one of the reasons she likes Craft Village is that she can walk to all the shops.<br /><br />Jean got up on Monday morning to go shopping. She shopped all day, and walked back to the Snooze Inn at 7:00 p.m. for dinner. After dinner, at around 8:30 p.m., she began walking to Northwoods Gallery. Half way there, she was accosted by a mugger. The mugger stood in front of her and shouted, \\\"Hand over your purse, or I\\\"ll beat you up!\\\" The mugger roughly snatched Jeans purse as she held it out to him. The mugger fled, and Jean turned around and ran back to the Snooze Inn. The mugger was later captured by the police.<br /><br />On what theory or theories, if any, might Jean recover damages from, and what defenses might she anticipate, in an action against:<br /><br />1. The mugger? Discuss.<br />2. Craft Village? Discuss.<br />3. Northwoods Gallery? Discuss. <br />4. Snooze Inn? Discuss.",
