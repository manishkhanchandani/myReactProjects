	"description": "Asssault occurs when one person <b>intentionally</b> places another in a state of fear. Certain elements must be present to prove an assault occurred: 1. The plaintiff <b>perceived immediate physical contact</b> with the defendant, 2. Plaintiff had suspicion that he was <b>in imminent danger</b>. 3. The <b>actions</b> of the defendant, or tortfeasor, <b>were intentional</b>, not accidental. <br /><br />Assault is an <b>intentional tort</b> when one is placed in <b>reasonable apprehension</b> of an intentional, imminent, unconsented, harmful, or offensive touching by another person. Assaults occur when the targeted person's anxiety is the product of the actor's threatening conduct, such as stalking or placing a gun in front of one's face (loaded or not). As long as the individual has a reasonable apprehension of some offensive contact, an assault has occurred. ",

The mugger stood in front of her and shouted, \"Hand over your purse, or I'll beat you up!\" The mugger roughly snatched Jean's purse as she held it out to him.",
			"explanation": "Your Rule will come here<br /><br />An act is intentional if it is done purposely knowingly that the results will follow.<br /><br />Here mugger acted <b>intentionally</b> because mugger shouted at Jean to \"Hand over your purse, or I'll beat you up,\" his conduct was volitional and therefore intentional. Here mugger did <b>Overt Act</b> because he took substantial step in shouting over Jean. Here there is <b>Reasonable Apprehension</b> because mere words alone are not adequate to cause apprehension. The words \"hand over your purse or I'll beat you up\" coupled with the fact that he had the present ability to carry the threat out indicates the placing of another in reasonable apprehension. Here there is Apprehension of <b>Immediate Battery</b> because mugger shouted \"I'll beat you up\" i.e. act of causing battery. <br /><br />Therefore, Mugger is liable for assault."

All of the stores are located on Main Street. There is one large gallery, Northwoods Gallery, at the north end of Main Street. At the south end of Main Street is the Snooze Inn, a large motel. Tourists often stay at the Snooze Inn when they want to spend more than a day in Craft Village. Craft Village shops, by town ordinance, must remain open from at least 10:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. every day, including Sundays. All of the shops close at 8:00 p.m. except Northwoods Gallery, which is open until 11:00 p.m. every night. Craft Village provides street lighting along Main Street, which is turned on each night at dusk.<br /><br />Jean arrived in Craft Village on Sunday night for her annual shopping expedition. As on all of her previous trips to Craft Village, she stayed at the Snooze Inn for two nights. She does not own a car, and one of the reasons she likes Craft Village is that she can walk to all the shops.<br /><br />Jean got up on Monday morning to go shopping. She shopped all day, and walked back to the Snooze Inn at 7:00 p.m. for dinner. After dinner, at around 8:30 p.m., she began walking to Northwoods Gallery.

The mugger stood in front of her and shouted, \\\"Hand over your purse, or I\\\"ll beat you up!\\\" The mugger roughly snatched Jeans purse as she held it out to him. The mugger fled, and Jean turned around and ran back to the Snooze Inn. The mugger was later captured by the police.<br /><br />On what theory or theories, if any, might Jean recover damages from, and what defenses might she anticipate, in an action against:<br /><br />1. The mugger? Discuss.<br />2. Craft Village? Discuss.<br />3. Northwoods Gallery? Discuss. <br />4. Snooze Inn? Discuss.",

The argument occurred in a very crowded college lecture hall between classes. During the argument, Dede picked up a heavy textbook and threw it at Alex. Alex shielded his head with his hands and ducked. The textbook missed Alex, but it hit Betty, who was standing behind Alex. The impact fractured Bettys nose.<br /><br />Enraged at missing Alex, Dede then picked up another textbook and threw it as hard as she could into a crowd of students gathered nearby. This second textbook struck Carl, who was standing in the crowd. As a result, Carl suffered a bruised rib.<br /><br />What intentional tort claims, if any, do Alex, Betty, and Carl have against Dede?
