			"description": "A driver if get distracted while driving and swerved while driving, it is his duty to avoid harm to the others based on duty of peril. If he does harm to others it is negligence due to breach of duty of peril. Here the driver negligently caused the pedestrian to suffer a legally compensible injury.",

					"question": "While a driver was taking a leisurely spring drive, he momentarily took his eyes off the road to look at some colorful trees in bloom. As a result, his car swerved a few feet off the roadway, directly toward a pedestrian, who was standing on the shoulder of the road waiting for a chance to cross. When the pedestrian saw the car bearing down on him, he jumped backwards, fell, and injured his knee.<br /><br />The pedestrian sued the driver for damages, and the driver moved for summary judgment. The foregoing facts are undisputed.<br /><br />The driver's motion should be",
					"answerOptions": [
						"denied, because the record shows that the pedestrian apprehended an imminent, harmful contact, with the driver's car.",
						"denied, because a jury could find that the driver negligently caused the pedestrian to suffer a legally compensible injury.",
						"granted, because the proximate cause of the pedestrian's injury was his own voluntary act.",
						"granted, because it is not unreasonable for a person to be distracted momentarily."
					],
					"correct": 1,
					"explanation": "B is the correct answer. A motion for summary judgment will be granted where there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. A question of fact exists as to whether the driver's negligence caused the pedestrian's reaction, or whether the pedestrian's injury was the result of his own act. Since a motion for summary judgment by the driver can only be rendered for the driver or denied, B is the only possible answer.<br /><br />A is incorrect. The driver did not act with the purpose of causing the pedestrian to apprehend an imminent harmful or offensive touching. The driver was merely inattentive, which is negligent rather than intentional.<br /><br />C is incorrect. The pedestrian's action was a cause in fact of his injury, but not necessarily the proximate cause. A summary judgment can only be granted if, as a matter of law, the driver is entitled to judgment and no material fact is in dispute. Clearly the driver and the pedestrian are disputing which of them is responsible for the pedestrian's taking the jump backwards.<br /><br />D is incorrect. While momentary distraction may not be unreasonable, the driver had a duty to drive safely, which was breached."
