					"answerOptions": [
						"Brunhilde posted a story on her website falsely saying that Roberta had been convicted of embezzlement five years ago.",
						"Roberta experienced severe emotional distress that she attributes to the publication of Brunhilde's false story on the website.",
						"Roberta has suffered harm to her reputation that she attributes to the publication of Brunhilde's false story on the website.",
						"Brunhilde's website, containing the false story about Roberta on its home page, is fully operative, and its history indicates that many visitors have clicked on the site."
					],
					"correct": 1,
					"explanation": "(EASY) Answer (B) is correct. Severe emotional distress is not an element of the prima facie case for defamation.<br /><br />Answer (A) is incorrect because a false statement about a person's embezzlement tends to lower the reputation of that person, and harm to reputation is a central element of the prima facie case for defamation.<br /><br />Answer (C) is incorrect for the same reason.<br /><br />Answer (D) is incorrect because \"publication,\" or the revelation of the defamatory communication to third parties, is an element of the prima facie case for defamation."

					"question": "137.   Editor Edsel printed a story in a daily newspaper, the Succotash Times, that described state senator Burt Bumpkin as corrupt. The story relied on an extensive, tape-recorded interview with a grandfather figure of organized crime, Magoo, who recalled his illegal contributions to Bumpkin's election campaign in the last year. Everything in the story that described Bumpkin's corruption was conveyed in quotations attributed to Magoo. Investigation has now revealed that Magoo suffers from senile dementia and in the interview had confused Bumpkin with another politician, long dead, whom he had bribed in decades past. His reminiscences about Bumpkin were false.Bumpkin brings an action against Edsel and the Succotash Times. Which of the following additional facts, if substantiated, would most strengthen Bumpkin's claim?",
					"answerOptions": [
						"During the interview, Magoo frequently referred to Bumpkin by the wrong name and apparently had trouble finishing his sentences.",
						"While admitting that he is a public figure, Bumpkin has asserted his \"right to privacy\" when reporters were investigating rumors of his marital infidelity.",
						"Edsel is a close friend of Bumpkin's archrival in the state senate, and actively desires the downfall of Bumpkin's career.",
						"The Succotash Times employs fact-checkers and prints a \"Corrections\" notice in each day's edition."
					],
					"correct": 0,
					"explanation": "(EASY) Answer (A) is correct. As a public official, Bumpkin must show that the Succotash Times acted either with a desire to lie or with reckless disregard for the truth of the statement it published. If its reporter should have been able to tell that Magoo was mentally incompetent, publishing Magoo's comments may satisfy the \"actual malice\" requirement of this tort.<br /><br />Answer (B) is incorrect because any \"right to privacy\" that Bumpkin asserts, or holds, does not affect his status as a defamation plaintiff.<br /><br />Answer (C) is incorrect, even though it may appear to show \"actual malice.\" The requirement of \"actual malice\" is not fulfilled by proving animus, however. Rather, the defendant must have either intended to tell a lie or been reckless about the truth.<br /><br />Answer (D) is incorrect because media defendants do not become more liable, or less liable, when they choose to employ fact-checkers or print Corrections notices."

Defamation law reluctantly recognizes that litigation often has the effect of hurting a person's reputation, as a side consequence of the matter being litigated. It tries to mitigate this harm by requiring a reasonable relation to the issues raised in the proceeding.<br /><br />Answer (B) sounds good, perhaps, but says almost nothing. Defamation in a judicial proceeding often has nothing to do with \"a matter of common public concern,\" to the extent that phrase refers to government.<br /><br />Answer (C) is incorrect, even though it is not far from the correct Answer (A).

					"question": "139.   Professional baseball pitcher Rooster McHew has long been suspected of resorting to \"spitballs\" — baseballs that a pitcher illicitly moistens with saliva — in violation of major league baseball rules. Although by tradition the rule has not been strictly enforced, a new commissioner has cracked down on pitchers, and now those who throw spitballs can lose their jobs. McHew has always denied the spitball rumors. At a recent game, news reporters gathered around old-timer Perry Gay, who retired from baseball decades ago, and asked him what he thought of McHew's successes. Perry Gay is the most infamous spitball-thrower in baseball history. \"I think he gets by with a little help from his friend,\" Gay replied to the question.Can Gay's remark support a defamation action by Rooster McHew against Gay?",
					"answerOptions": [
						"No, because McHew has consented to Gay's expression of opinion.",
						"No, because Gay's words are innocuous and cannot harm McHew's reputation.",
						"Yes, because a reasonable person would infer that Gay was referring to spitballs.",
						"Yes, because the privilege to offer an opinion on a matter of public comment is not present under these facts."
					],
					"correct": 2,
					"explanation": "(EASY) Answer (C) is correct. This question addresses what courts used to call \"innuendo\" — the meaning of an ambiguous statement. Given what Gay is famous for and the subtext surrounding the reporters' question, a listener would infer that Gay was saying that McHew throws spitballs.<br /><br />Answer (A) is incorrect because we don't know whether McHew has consented to anything.<br /><br />Answer (B) is incorrect because the words are not innocuous and could harm McHew's reputation.<br /><br />Answer (D) is incorrect because (among other reasons) we don't know whether Gay was offering an opinion on a matter of public comment."

Channel 7 News, based in the town of Eureka, aired a segment called \"Rooted in Slavery\" that looked at institutions and individuals who had lived in Eureka as slaveholders and enslaved persons in the nineteenth century. \"Rooted in Slavery\" took a \"Where are they now?\" look at this history, interviewing several successors and descendants of these institutions and individuals. The program claimed that Paul Henry Shipley, who had been the mayor of Eureka from 1851 to 1855, had owned five slaves. This statement was false. Shipley had never owned a single slave and had indeed participated in the abolitionist movement.

					"explanation": "(EASY) Answer (B) is correct.

					"correct": 2,

The opportunity to criticize government officials is more fundamental to free speech than the opportunity to criticize the more eclectic, often apolitical, \"public figures.\" Accordingly, public officials have more onerous obstacles when they sue for defamation.<br /><br />Answer (A) is incorrect for the reasons just stated above.<br /><br />Answer (B) is incorrect for the same reasons; in addition to being unsuccessful to support the point, this claim is probably not true.<br /><br />Answer (D) is incorrect because even though public officials do enjoy relative immunity from defamation liability, the rationale for the relative immunity does not support making them suffer as plaintiffs."

The speech included an accusation by Lawrie that local millionaire Milton employed undocumented workers to clean and serve food at his chain of hotels. This accusation was false, and Milton believes he suffered financial loss as a consequence.

Restatement (Second) of Torts § 559 gives a definition of a defamatory statement that the courts cite frequently: it is a communication that tends to lower the plaintiff in the esteem of the community, or deter people from associating with her. Almost any statement about a person can be \"defamatory,\" however, in the sense that someone might find the statement disgraceful. For example, calling a high schooler \"an A student\" might hurt her reputation at some schools.How do courts deal with this problem in their definition of \"defamatory\"?<br /><br />(HARD) Not entirely satisfactorily. The class of potentially defamatory statements is nearly infinite. Courts modify the Restatement formulation slightly to hold that a statement is not defamatory unless it is likely to cause a substantial number of people to avoid the plaintiff or hold her in less esteem.
