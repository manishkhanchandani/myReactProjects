In the process, Bob got injured badly. If Bob asserts claim against Jean for personal injuries, will he prevail?",
			"explanation": "Your Rule will come here<br /><br />Here Jean <b>created a Peril Situation</b> because he was siphoning the gas from friends car without consent and gas is a dangerous substance if handled improperly. And fact does not show that Jean was a professional in this matter. Here <b>Bob saves the Jean</b> because when gasoline exploded, it catches fire and Bob took fire extinguisher to save the Jean. Here <b>Bob got injured</b> because while he was saving Jean, he got severely injured in the process. Here Bob is <b>not a professional rescuer</b> because fact does not say that Bob is a fireman or something who assumes the risks of saving others as a professional conduct.<br /><br />Therefore Jean will be liable for the injures suffered by Bob."

					"question": "A man was in the act of siphoning gasoline from a neighbor's car in the neighbor's garage and without his consent when the gasoline exploded and caused a fire. A rescuer, seeing the fire, grabbed a fire extinguisher from his car and put out the fire, saving the man's life and the neighbor's car and garage. In doing so, the rescuer was badly burned.<br /><br />If the rescuer asserts a claim against the man for personal injuries, the rescuer will",
					"answerOptions": [
						"prevail, because he saved the man's life.",
						"prevail, because the man was at fault in causing the fire.",
						"not prevail, because the rescuer knowingly assumed the risk.",
						"not prevail, because the rescuer's action was not a foreseeable consequence of the man's conduct."
					],
					"correct": 1,
					"explanation": "B is correct. The man will be liable to the rescuer because the rescuer is a foreseeable plaintiff as long as the rescue was reasonably conducted. Since the man negligently caused a fire and put himself in danger, he is liable for the injury to the rescuer who was injured in the attempted rescue. Thus, D is incorrect. A is incorrect because a rescuer needs only to be injured in attempting the rescue to recover. C is incorrect because an attempted rescue is not an assumption of risk if the rescue is attempted in a reasonable fashion."
