The duty to protect applies to defects that are: (1) known to the business, (2) dangerous, and (3) non-obvious to the invitee. This liability may be abated if the invitee became a trespasser by entering an area that was restricted and off-limits to visitors.

					"question": "A plaintiff entered a drug store to make some purchases. As he was searching the aisles for various items, he noticed a display card containing automatic pencils. The display card was on a high shelf behind a cashier's counter. The plaintiff saw a sign on the counter that read, \"No Admittance, Employees Only.\" Seeing no clerks in the vicinity to help him, the plaintiff went behind the counter to get a pencil. A clerk then appeared behind the counter and asked whether she could help him. He said he just wanted a pencil and that he could reach the display card himself. The clerk said nothing further. While reaching for the display card, the plaintiff stepped sideways into an open shaft and fell to the basement, ten feet below. The clerk knew of the presence of the open shaft, and had reason to believe that the plaintiff had not noticed it when stepping behind the counter.<br /> <br /> The plaintiff sued the drug store to recover damages for the injuries he sustained in the fall. The jurisdiction has adopted a rule of pure comparative negligence, and it follows traditional common-law rules governing the duties of a land possessor.<br /> <br /> Will the plaintiff recover a judgment against the drug store?",
					"answerOptions": [
						"A. No, because the plaintiff was a trespasser.",
						"B. No, because the plaintiff's injuries did not result from the defendant's willful or wanton misconduct.",
						"C. Yes, because the premises were defective with respect to a public invitee.",
						"D. Yes, because the clerk had reason to believe that the plaintiff was unaware of the open shaft."

If a customer wanders into an off-limits area, the only duty the business owes is to refrain from willful and wanton conduct.<br /> <br /> The first issue in this question is the customer's status. The facts state that the customer went into an \"Employees Only\" area. However, an employee observed the plaintiff and allowed the entry. Therefore, the plaintiff is not a trespasser in this situation, but an invitee. Thus, A and B are incorrect. The second issue is whether the hazard was open and obvious, thus abating the drug store's liability. Choice D appropriately addresses the issue that the clerk had a duty to warn the plaintiff of the danger if he had reason to believe that the plaintiff was unaware of the open shaft. C is not the best answer because the store only has a duty to warn if the defect is non-obvious. A, B, and C are incorrect."

The risk that materialized here is not inherent to bowling but could arise whenever someone is careless while holding a heavy object.

The driver didn't start the fire (intentionally or negligently), so he is not liable for all the consequences, unforeseeable or unintended. C is an incorrect statement. Long-settled case law allows defendant liability for concurrent acts that combine with or create a greater injury than would have occurred under the original harm alone. D is incorrect.

The pedestrian was in a hurry, and so before reaching the north curb on the street, she cut to her left diagonally across the street to the east-west crosswalk and started across it. Just after reaching the east-west crosswalk, the traffic light turned green in her favor. She proceeded about five steps further across the street to the west in the crosswalk when she was struck by a car approaching from her right that she thought would stop, but did not. The car was driven by a driver, 81 years of age, who failed to stop his car after seeing that the traffic light was red against him. The pedestrian had a bone disease, resulting in very brittle bones, that is prevalent in only 0.02 percent of the population. As a result of the impact the pedestrian suffered a broken leg and the destruction of her family heirloom, a Picasso original painting that she was taking to her bank for safekeeping. The painting had been purchased by the pedestrian's grandmother for $750 but was valued at $500,000 at the time of the accident.<br /> <br /> A pedestrian has filed suit against the driver. The driver's attorney has alleged that the pedestrian violated a state statute requiring that pedestrians stay in crosswalks, and that if the pedestrian had not violated the statute she would have had to walk 25 feet more to reach the impact point and therefore would not have been at a place where she could have been hit by the driver. The pedestrian's attorney ascertains that there is a statute as alleged by the driver, that his measurements are correct, that there is a state statute requiring observance of traffic lights, and that the driver's license expired two years prior to the collision.<br /> <br /> The failure of the driver to have a valid driver's license has which of the following effects?",

The motorist tried to stop, but the brakes failed, and the two cars collided. If the brakes had been in proper working order, the motorist could have stopped in time to avoid the collision. The motorist and his wife were injured.<br /> <br /> If the motorist asserts a claim against the friend, will the motorist prevail?",
					"answerOptions": [
						"Yes, in negligence, because the friend knew the brakes were faulty and failed to tell the motorist.",
						"Yes, in strict liability, because the car was defective, and the friend lent it to the motorist.",
						"No, because the friend was a gratuitous lender, and thus his duty of care was slight.",
						"No, because the failure of the motorist's wife to tell the motorist about the brakes was the cause in fact of the motorist's harm."
					],
					"correct": 0,
					"explanation": "A is the correct response. The friend had a duty of reasonable care to inform the motorist of the faulty brakes. The friend's failure to do so was a breach of that duty, causing injury to the motorist, which was not superseded by the wife's foreseeable failure to warn. The motorist will prevail in a negligence claim against the friend.<br /> <br /> B is incorrect. Strict liability can only be imposed if there was a sale of a defective or unreasonably dangerous product. Strict liability for physical harm to the motorist would only be available if the friend were engaged in the business of selling cars. The facts do not support this conclusion, so strict liability is inapplicable to this situation.<br /> <br /> C is incorrect. There is no lesser duty of care simply because no fee was paid for the use of the car. The friend had a duty of reasonable care.<br /> <br /> D is not the best answer. The wife's failure to warn the motorist was a foreseeable risk the friend took when he failed to warn the motorist himself. The wife's failure is a dependent, foreseeable intervening action which does not supersede the friend's liability. Therefore, while the wife's failure to warn was a cause-in-fact of the harm, the friend's failure remains the legal cause and basis of liability for the motorist's harm."

					"correct": 3,
					"explanation": "D is the correct answer. Generally, there is no affirmative duty to act. However, four exceptions exist: (i) if the defendant voluntarily assumes a duty, (ii) if the peril was caused by the defendant's own conduct, (iii) if a special relationship exists between the parties; and (iv) if the defendant has a duty to control a third party. A person assumes a duty to act by voluntarily beginning to aid someone in peril. Once aid has begun, the actor has a duty to use reasonable care in continuing to administer aid. Here A is incorrect because there is no general duty to act to help a stranger, and there has been no assumption of duty either.<br /> <br /> B and C are also incorrect because, although there is a duty to act within a special relationship, neighbor and cousin generally do not fall within the category unless especially close or special for an additional reason. Common examples of special relationships that owe a duty of care are parent-child, employer-employee, common carriers and innkeepers, and parties in privity such as through contract.<br /> <br /> D is the correct answer because the defendant's own conduct gave rise to the situation of peril, creating an affirmative duty to aid or assist. Peril caused by the defendant's own conduct, whether negligent or innocent, triggers an affirmative duty to aid or assist the person put in harms way."

					"question": "A defendant and a group of his friends are fanatical basketball fans who regularly meet at each others' homes to watch basketball games on television. Some of the group are fans of team A, and others are fans of team B. When the group has watched televised games between these two teams, fights sometimes have broken out among the group. Despite this fact, the defendant invited the group to his home to watch a championship game between teams A and B.<br /> <br /> During the game, the defendant's guests became rowdy and antagonistic. Fearing that they would begin to fight, and that a fight would damage his possessions, the defendant asked his guests to leave. They refused to go and soon began to fight. The defendant called the police, and a police officer was sent to the defendant's home. The officer sustained a broken nose in his efforts to stop the fighting.<br /> <br /> The officer brought an action against the defendant alleging that the defendant was negligent in inviting the group to his house to watch this championship game. The defendant has moved to dismiss the complaint.<br /> <br /> The best argument in support of this motion would be that",
					"answerOptions": [
						"a rescuer injured while attempting to avert a danger cannot recover damages from the endangered person.",

						"The defendant did not owe the officer a duty to use reasonable care, because the officer was a mere licensee on the defendant's property."
					],
					"correct": 1,
					"explanation": "B is the correct answer because it states what is known as \"The Firefighter's Rule.\" The officer was injured by a peril that he was employed to confront. If the peril was created through negligence or was caused by a strict liability activity, the officer generally has no claim against the landowner (the defendant). Most states use the rule to treat the officer as a mere licensee who must take the premises as he finds them. This would allow the officer to recover in limited cases involving premises open to the public. In the facts of this situation, however, the officer was called to the defendant's private residence, where recovery would be barred. Thus, D is incorrect.<br /> <br /> A is incorrect. If the policeman were an ordinary rescuer, he could recover damages if his injury was a foreseeable result of negligent conduct by the individual he was rescuing.

Safety statutes are used only if the statute violated was designed to protect the particular class of foreseeable victim that the plaintiff belonged to, and the harm the plaintiff suffered was the type that the statute was designed to protect. If the safety statute applies, in a majority jurisdiction it establishes duty and breach (negligence per se), while in a minority jurisdiction it only serves as evidence of negligence.

					"question": "Click here to view diagram. (231and232.jpg)<br /> <br /> Maple Street is a local public thoroughfare, designated as a one-way street for northbound traffic. Pine Street is a public thoroughfare, designated as a one-way street for eastbound traffic. Maple and Pine Streets intersect at right angles. The intersection is controlled by traffic lights. There are two sets of lights, one at the northeast corner and one at the northwest corner, for traffic on Maple Street. There are two sets of lights, one at the northeast corner and one at the southeast corner, for traffic on Pine Street.<br /> <br /> A trucker was making a delivery to a market on the east side of Maple Street, just north of its intersection with Pine Street. There being insufficient space for his truck and enclosed trailer, he parked it with the rear of the trailer extending entirely across the crosswalk on the north side of the intersection. The height of the trailer was such that it entirely obscured the traffic light on the northeast corner from the view of traffic moving east on Pine Street. Unknown to the trucker, the traffic light at the southeast corner was not functioning, because a collision seventy-two hours earlier had knocked down the pole from which the light was suspended.<br /> <br /> A visitor, on his first trip to the city, was driving east on Pine Street. Not seeing any traffic light or pole, he entered the intersection at a time when the light was red for eastbound traffic and green for northbound traffic. A driver, proceeding north on Maple Street and seeing the green light, entered the intersection without looking for any cross traffic and struck the visitor's car. The driver received personal injuries, and the visitor's car was damaged severely as a result of the impact.<br /> <br /> State statutes make it a misdemeanor (1) to park a motor vehicle so that any part projects into a crosswalk, and (2) to enter an intersection contrary to a traffic signal.<br /> <br /> If the driver asserts a claim against the city, the theory on which he has the best chance of prevailing is that the city",
					"answerOptions": [
						"is strictly liable for harm caused by a defective traffic signal.",
						"was negligent in not replacing the broken pole within seventy-two hours.",
						"had an absolute duty to maintain installed traffic signals in good operating order.",
						"created a dangerous trap by not promptly replacing the broken pole."
					],
					"correct": 1,
					"explanation": "B is the best answer. Remember that the city is a municipality with tort immunity limitations set by the state as a sovereign. The instruction is to determine the theory with the best chance of prevailing against the city. Municipalities are generally immune from tort liability with the following exceptions: (1) torts committed in a proprietary capacity (as opposed to governmental), (2) municipality-created nuisances, and in some states, (3) negligently maintained municipal property, roads, streets and sewers. While it may not succeed, a claim arguing municipal property includes a broken light pole that was negligently left for three days (without the minimal maintenance of at least erecting temporary stop signs) would have the best chance of success. The other choices leave no chance of success at all.<br /> <br /> A has no chance of success. Strict liability is almost never applied to a governmental entity, even where immunities have otherwise been abolished.<br /> <br /> C has no chance of success. Absolute duty is a higher standard applied to common carriers or landowners/occupiers that results in strict liability, but is generally only applied to damages resulting from ultra-hazardous activities or conditions. Even if a broken stoplight could be classified as an abnormally dangerous or ultra-hazardous condition, immunity from strict liability is generally granted to a government entity (with only a handful of exceptions regarding governmental common carriers, based on their apparent ability to build risk distribution into the freight rates of the hazardous cargo).<br /> <br /> D is incorrect. A municipality does not owe a higher duty of care than a landowner to an invitee. That standard is to make conditions reasonably safe within a reasonable (non-substantial) period of time. The standard set forth in D would invoke strict liability, which is almost never applied to a governmental entity."

Under some circumstances, the rental agency could be liable even though it did not hide the bomb. If it were reasonably foreseeable that a bomb might be planted in a rental car (for example, because that practice had become a common terrorist tactic in the area), a reasonably prudent rental agency would routinely search for such a device before renting out the car.

The mechanic was severely burned.<br /> <br /> The mechanic has brought an action to recover damages against the man and woman. The jurisdiction has adopted a pure comparative negligence rule in place of the traditional common-law rule of contributory negligence. The jury found that while a reasonable person in the man's position would have warned the mechanic about the gasoline leak, the man had no actual knowledge of the risk that the gasoline leak presented.<br /> <br /> In this action, will the mechanic obtain an judgment against the man?",

						"No, because it was the mechanic's job to inspect the vehicle and repair whatever needed repair.",
						"No, because the man was not aware of the risk that the gasoline leak presented.",
						"Yes, because a reasonable person in the man's position would have warned the mechanic about the gasoline leak.",

Therefore, the man had a duty to inform the mechanic of the leak, because a reasonably prudent person in the man's position would given a warning. Therefore, C is the correct answer.<br /> <br /> A is incorrect. Although the statement is true, the mechanic's negligence, while diminishing his damages, will not prevent him from prevailing on his claim. In a pure comparative negligence jurisdiction, the plaintiff is entitled to all of his damages minus the portion that the court attributes to the plaintiff's negligence. B is incorrect. The man's conduct is subject to the objective reasonable person standard. Under that standard, his actual understanding of the risk is irrelevant. D is incorrect because it combines elements of products liability with a landowner's liability for abnormally dangerous activity on his land. The man is a user, not a manufacturer or seller of the car, so he will not be held strictly liable for the leaking gas tank. Likewise, the man was not conducting ultra hazardous activities that would create a nondelegable duty resulting in strict liability. Instead, the mechanic must prove negligent conduct by the man to prevail."

					"answerOptions": [
						"Yes, because the defendant knew that the stove was defective.",
						"Yes, because the defendant could have discovered the defect in the stove by a reasonable inspection.",
						"No, because the defendant had no reason to anticipate the plaintiff's presence in the cabin.",

					"correct": 2,
					"explanation": "C is correct. The defendant had no duty to exercise care or put the cabin in a safe condition for the plaintiff because the plaintiff was an unknown/undiscovered trespasser. The plaintiff's mistake of fact with regard to the cabin's ownership does not change her status with regard to the defendant. A landowner's only duty to a trespasser begins once the trespasser is discovered or if the defendant was or should have been aware that members of the public were known to frequently trespass on his property. The facts do not support this conclusion, as the plaintiff was a hiker who approached several empty cabins. C addresses the appropriate element at issue.<br /> <br /> A is incorrect because it gives the standard of care owed to a licensee. B is incorrect because it gives the standard of care owed to an invitee. D is incorrect because the private necessity privilege does not give rise to any affirmative duty on the part of the landowner, it only serves to supersede a landowner's privilege to defend his property from trespass. Even if the plaintiff's presence in the cabin came through private necessity, it would not change the defendant's duty as the plaintiff would still be an unanticipated trespasser."

The pedestrian was in a hurry, and so before reaching the north curb on the street, she cut to her left diagonally across the street to the east-west crosswalk and started across it. Just after reaching the east-west crosswalk, the traffic light turned green in her favor. She proceeded about five steps further across the street to the west in the crosswalk when she was struck by a car approaching from her right that she thought would stop, but did not. The car was driven by a driver, 81 years of age, who failed to stop his car after seeing that the traffic light was red against him. The pedestrian had a bone disease, resulting in very brittle bones, that is prevalent in only 0.02 percent of the population. As a result of the impact, the pedestrian suffered a broken leg and the destruction of her family heirloom, a Picasso original painting that she was taking to her bank for safekeeping. The painting had been purchased by the pedestrian's grandmother for $750 but was valued at $500,000 at the time of the accident.<br /> <br /> The pedestrian has filed suit against the driver. The driver's attorney has alleged that the pedestrian violated a state statute requiring that pedestrians stay in crosswalks, and that if the pedestrian had not violated the statute, she would have had to walk 25 feet more to reach the impact point and therefore would not have been at a place where she could have been hit by the driver. The pedestrian's attorney ascertains that there is a statute as alleged by the driver, that his measurements are correct, that there is a state statute requiring observance of traffic lights, and that the driver's license expired two years prior to the collision.<br /> <br /> The pedestrian's violation of the crosswalk statute should not be considered by the jury because",

The plant burns lignite, a low grade fuel which is available in large quantities.<br /> <br /> Although the plant was constructed in accordance with the best practicable technology, the plant emits a substantial quantity of invisible fumes. The only way the utility company can reduce the fumes is by the use of scrubbing equipment that would cost $50,000,000 to install and would increase the retail price of generated electricity by 50 percent while reducing the volume of fumes by only 20 percent. Because of the expense of such equipment and its relative ineffectiveness, no other generating plants burning lignite use such equipment.<br /> <br /> The plant was located in a sparsely settled rural area, remote from the large city served by the utility company.<br /> <br /> A farmer owned a farm adjacent to the plant. He had farmed the land for forty years and lived on the premises. The prevailing winds carried fumes from the new plant over the farmer's land. His 2006 crop was less than half the average size of this crop over the five years immediately preceding the construction of the plant. It can be established that the fumes caused the crop reduction.<br /> <br /> The farmer's hay fever, from which he had long suffered, became worse in 2006.

The gate to the field was latched and could not be opened by an animal. The rancher had never had any trouble with people coming onto his property and bothering the horse, and the horse had never escaped from the field. One day, however, when the rancher went to the field, he found that the gate was open and the horse was gone. Shortly before the rancher's discovery, a driver was driving with due care on a nearby highway when suddenly the rancher's horse darted in front of his car. When the driver attempted to avoid hitting the horse, he lost control of the car, which then crashed into a tree. The driver was injured.<br /> <br /> The driver sued the rancher to recover damages for his injuries and the rancher moved for summary judgment.<br /> <br /> If the facts stated above are undisputed, the judge should",

					"explanation": "A and C will both be given credit. Sometimes even the Examiners cannot agree on the correct response! A motion for summary judgment will be granted where there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. A and C are opposite sides of the res ipsa loquitur (RIL) argument. The doctrine of RIL is generally applied in situations where negligence clearly occurred and (1) the defendant had exclusive control of the instrumentality during the relevant time, and (2) the plaintiff shows that he was not responsible for the injury. The court is not required to infer negligence and no presumption is created; RIL merely permits the fact finder to infer negligence from the facts. Thus, either A or C could be correct, depending on the determination of the judge. Most jurisdictions hold that a plaintiff is not entitled to a directed verdict merely because the defendant did not rebut an RIL case. In this situation, however, the defendant made the motion.<br /> <br /> B states an incorrect reason. The horse is livestock. As such, in common law, the rancher would be held in strict liability for its trespass.

The nurse's professional role is relevant because it might support a defense based on assumption of risk. The nurse's specialty training is relevant because it might support a defense based on either assumption of risk or contributory negligence. The patient could argue that a professional with the nurse's training should have foreseen the risk of this happening and taken steps to protect herself. The patient's mental state is relevant because the patient's actions were no doubt caused by the mental illness and thus fell within the risks likely assumed and anticipated by the nurse.

The nurse, a paid employee of the facility who was trained to care for schizophrenic patients, was injured. The patient is an indigent whose care is paid for by the government.<br /> <br /> The jurisdiction generally follows the rule that a person with a mental deficiency is held to the standard of a reasonable person. In a negligence action brought by the nurse against the patient, the patient's lawyer will argue that the patient should not be held responsible for the nurse's injury.<br /> <br /> Which of the following facts will be LEAST helpful to the patient's lawyer's argument?",

						"The nurse was a professional caregiver.",

			"description": "The plaintiff's evidence that the decedent violated the statute and crossed over the centerline establishes a prima facie case of negligence. However, the prima facie case of negligence may be rebutted by showing that compliance with the statute was beyond the defendant's control. Here, the decedent's estate successfully rebutted the plaintiff's evidence by providing an undisputed explanation of how the accident happened that is inconsistent with a finding of negligence (the decedent's unforeseeable heart attack made her unable to comply with the statute or, indeed, with any standard of care).

					"question": "In a civil action, a plaintiff sued a decedent's estate to recover damages for injuries she suffered in a collision between her car and one driven by the decedent. At trial, the plaintiff introduced undisputed evidence that the decedent's car had swerved across the centerline of the highway into oncoming traffic, where it had collided with the plaintiff's car. The decedent's estate introduced undisputed evidence that, before he swerved across the centerline, the decedent had suffered a fatal heart attack, which he had no reason to foresee, and that, just prior to the heart attack, the decedent had been driving at a reasonable speed and in a reasonable manner. A statute makes it a traffic offense to cross the median of a highway.<br /> <br /> In this case, which party is likely to prevail?",
					"answerOptions": [
						"The decedent's estate, because its rebuttal evidence is undisputed.",
						"The decedent's estate, because the plaintiff has not established a prima facie case of liability.",
						"The plaintiff, because the accident was of a type that does not ordinarily happen in the absence of negligence on the actor's part.",

This answer correctly states that the decedent's estate will prevail, but it misstates the legal basis for this conclusion.

It may or may not be true that accidents of this type do not ordinarily happen in the absence of negligence, but whether they do is irrelevant.

			"description": "In general, an independent contractor is liable for his own torts. However, an exception exists where the contractor is carrying out an inherently dangerous activity or where there is a public policy consideration that makes the duty nondelegable. The facts indicate that the duty to make the sidewalk safe for pedestrians was a nondelegable duty. (Ref 1436)",
			"examples": [
				{
					"question": "While walking on a public sidewalk, a pedestrian was struck by a piece of lumber that fell from the roof of a homeowner's house. The homeowner had hired a repairman to make repairs to his roof, and the lumber fell through due to negligence on the repairman's part.<br /> <br /> Assume that the homeowner exercised reasonable care in hiring the repairman, that the repairman was an independent contractor, and that <b>public policy</b> made a <b>homeowner's duty</b> to keep the sidewalk safe for pedestrian<b> a nondelegable duty</b>. If the pedestrian brings an action against the homeowner to recover damages for the injury caused to him by the repairman's negligence, will the pedestrian prevail?",
					"answerOptions": [
						"Yes, under the res ipsa loquitur doctrine.",
						"Yes, because the repairman's act was a breach of a nondelegable duty owed by the homeowner to the pedestrian.",
						"No, because the repairman was an independent contractor rather than the homeowner's servant.",
						"No, because the homeowner exercised reasonable care in hiring the repairman to do the repair."
					],
					"correct": 1,
					"explanation": "B is the correct answer. In general, an independent contractor is liable for his own torts. However, an exception exists where the contractor is carrying out an inherently dangerous activity or where there is a public policy consideration that makes the duty nondelegable. The facts indicate that the duty to make the sidewalk safe for pedestrians was a nondelegable duty. Therefore, Answer B is the best choice.<br /> <br /> Answer A is inapplicable on the facts, which clearly state that the repairman was negligent. Res ipsa loquitur is only used where proof of negligence must be inferred.<br /> <br /> Answer C reaches the wrong conclusion. The homeowner will still be held liable for the actions of an independent contractor because he had a nondelegable duty. The word \"servant\" is a term of art and refers to a hired individual with duties defined and under the control of the one who did the hiring.<br /> <br /> Answer D is not the best answer. Even though the homeowner exercised reasonable care in hiring the repairman, he still had a nondelegable duty to keep the sidewalk safe."
