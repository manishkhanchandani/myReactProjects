					"question": "A widow recently purchased a new uncrated electric range for her kitchen from a local retailer. The range has a wide oven with a large oven door. The crate in which the manufacturer shipped the range carried a warning label that the stove would tip over with a weight of 25 pounds or more on the oven door. The widow has one child, aged 3. Recently, the child was playing on the floor of the kitchen while the widow was heating water in a pan on the stove. When the widow left the kitchen for a moment, the child opened the oven door and climbed on it to see what was in the pan. The child's weight (25 pounds) on the door caused the stove to tip over forward. The child fell to the floor and the hot water spilled over her, burning her severely. The widow ran to the kitchen and immediately gave her first aid treatment for burns. The child thereafter received medical treatment.<br /> <br /> The child's burns were painful. They have now healed and do not bother her, but she has ugly scars on her legs and back. The child's claim is asserted on her behalf by the proper party.<br /> <br /> If the child asserts a claim based on strict liability against the manufacturer, she must establish that",
					"answerOptions": [
						"the defendant negligently designed the stove.",
						"stoves made by other manufacturers do not turn over with a 25-pound weight on the oven door.",
						"the defendant failed to warn the widow and her that the stove would turn over easily.",
						"the stove was defective and unreasonably dangerous to her."
					],
					"correct": 3,
					"explanation": "D is the correct answer and can be reached by the process of elimination. The facts indicate that the stove arrived exactly as it was designed. This is a defective design case. For strict liability to apply in defective design, the plaintiff must prevail in a risk-utility balancing test where the child must show that the risk and severity of her injuries were predictable to her as a small child. In some jurisdictions, the court would then consider the feasibility of alternative designs. Other jurisdictions shift the burden to the defendant (once plaintiff proves causation) requiring the manufacturer to show that the utility of the design outweighs the inherent danger. A warning does not need to be verbal.<br /> <br /> The stove came with a written warning, so C can be eliminated. The risk-utility test is similar to the negligence standard but, since the question states the claim theory, answer A can be eliminated as an inappropriate standard. The presence of other stoves in the industry that do not tip with 25 pounds of weight would be part of the determination of the feasibility of other, safer designs, so \"B\" is not the best answer. D is the most complete response and states the rule rather than applicable facts. A, B and C are incorrect."

					"question": "Tony started to boil water for instant cocoa in a brand new, inexpensive electric tea kettle. This kettle had arrived at his home the day before via an online order from the manufacturer. The kettle had a handle on one side, a spout on the other, and a lid on top. Users remove the lid, fill the kettle with cold water, replace the lid, and plug the kettle into an outlet. Tony duly complied with these tasks. As Tony tipped the kettle to pour water into a mug, the handle broke off, splashing boiling water onto his arm.Tony, who suffered burns, prevailed in a strict products liability action against the manufacturer. Which of the conclusions about this action is most likely to be well founded?",
					"answerOptions": [
						"The kettle had a defective warning.",
						"The kettle was designed defectively: putting the handle on top as opposed to on the side of the kettle would have decreased the risk of the handle breaking off.",
						"The kettle was designed defectively: under normal use the handle of a brand new kettle does not break off.",
						"The kettle was manufactured defectively."
					],
					"correct": 3,
					"explanation": "(EASY) Answer (D) is correct. The facts describe what is most probably a manufacturing defect involving a flaw in the adhesive or mounting of the handle.<br /><br />Answer (A) is incorrect because the problem says nothing about the role of a warning in this injury. Tony appeared to have handled the kettle correctly.<br /><br />Answer (B) is incorrect because it doesn't make sense as an alternative design. The top of the kettle was already occupied by a lid. Putting a handle on top seems to increase the risk of burns as steam rises.<br /><br />Answer (C) is incorrect because although under normal use a brand new kettle handle does not break off, this result does not show that it was defectively designed.

Cliff was temporarily blinded, and as a result, lost control of the car and went off the road. Diane, a passenger in Cliff's car, was badly injured in the accident.

					"explanation": "(EASY) Answer (C) is correct. These facts give rise to a simple products liability case based on manufacturing defect. Courts hold that such cases may be brought on a strict liability theory, which is extremely easy to prove if the defect is known. Because the facts indicate that the handle was defective, this essentially leaves only the question of whether the defect was a cause in fact of her harm, and that will be simple in this case. It does not matter that Diane did not purchase the car.<br /><br />Answer (A) is incorrect because a negligence case is necessarily more difficult to prove, even aided by the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur. Diane will have to demonstrate that this is the type of defect that usually results from negligence in the manufacturing process, something she does not need to show under the strict products liability theory.<br /><br />Answer (B) is incorrect because the facts do not indicate that there was an express warranty covering this kind of situation.<br /><br />Answer (D) is incorrect because in the products liability context, \"absolute liability\" is more of an academic phrase than a cause of action.

In-line skates provide a fast, exciting ride, but they are also more dangerous than old-fashioned roller skates. The parents of six-year-old Joni bought her a pair of in-line skates manufactured by RollersInc. As soon as she received her skates, Joni ran to the top of a hill, put on the skates, and took off. It wasn't as easy as she expected it to be. Joni's ankles collapsed inward as she gained speed, and she fell hard, sustaining serious injuries.

						"In-line skates are more expensive than traditional rollerskates."
					],
					"correct": 1,
					"explanation": "(EASY) Answer (B) is correct. Under the Restatement, the plaintiff's own fault may be used to reduce her recovery in a products liability action. A jury might view plaintiff's having tried to skate down a hill the first time she donned a pair of in-line skates as an act of comparative fault. This will reduce her recovery against RollersInc.<br /><br />Answer (A) is incorrect because any negligence on the part of Joni's parents in buying the in-line skates does not affect the liability of RollersInc to Joni. Put differently, the negligence of Joni's parents, if any, will not be imputed to Joni so as to reduce her recovery.<br /><br />Answer (C) is incorrect because a manufacturer is responsible not only for injuries to intended users, but also to others who might foreseeably use the product. This is an application of the \"foreseeable misuse\" doctrine.<br /><br />Answer (D) is incorrect because the cost of the skates is irrelevant to whether they were defective."

					"explanation": "(MEDIUM) Answer (D) is correct. Pamela's case is based on an alleged design defect. It is not a typical design defect case in which some basic feature of the car causes an accident, but the cell phone is part of the car nevertheless, and if it is unreasonably dangerous to equip a car with the appliance, the car can be viewed as defective. The Restatement favors a risk-utility test for determining design defect. Thus, if the risks created by having a cell phone in the car outweigh its benefits, a jury may deem the car defective.<br /><br />Answer (A) is incorrect because plaintiff in a products liability case need not have been exposed involuntarily to the defective product in order to recover. Indeed, in most products cases, it is the user of the product who sues.<br /><br />Answer (B) is incorrect because the problem states that Lexura's automobiles are the only ones equipped with built-in phones that are sold in the U.S. market. The alternative design that Pamela has in mind is available in everyday life. If her theory of defect were more elaborate — for example, that the automobile was defective because it did not contain a safer version of a built-in phone — then under the Third Restatement Pamela would need a reasonable alternative design. But as stated, her objection to the design is only that it contained a phone.<br /><br />Answer (C) is incorrect because plaintiff in a products liability case need not prove that the seller or manufacturer made any misrepresentations.

She modified the skates for the purpose of achieving great speed. Her experience in skating for about an hour before her accident also probably added to her appreciation of the dangers posed by the modified skates. Thus, RollersInc has a viable argument that Sally voluntarily confronted a known and appreciated hazard.<br /><br />Answer (D) is incorrect because Sally's modification might constitute an unforeseeable misuse of the skates. Though sellers are responsible for foreseeable misuse, they are not liable for unforeseeable uses. Because the wheel brackets were welded in place and were very difficult to modify, it is likely that a reasonable manufacturer in the position of RollersInc would not think it very likely that someone would make this modification.

While other companies inspect each skate once, Skatz puts each skate through three inspections. This care is costly for Skatz, and any additional costs would make the skates unprofitable. Despite these procedures, the left skate in a pair purchased by Greg from a sporting goods store left the Skatz plant with a weak wheel mount. After Greg had used the skates for a month, the weak wheel mount suddenly gave way, causing the left skate to collapse, and Greg to fall and injure himself.If Greg brings an action against Skatz for product liability citing the Restatement (Third) of Torts: (Products Liability), which of the following statements is most accurate?",
					"answerOptions": [
						"Because Greg was injured by a product manufactured by Skatz that deviated from its intended design and caused his injury, Greg can recover.",
						"Because Skatz cannot operate profitably with any quality control procedures beyond those it already uses, Skatz cannot be held liable.",
						"Because Skatz's quality control procedures exceeded even what would be considered reasonable care, Skatz cannot be held liable.",
						"Because Greg could recover directly from the store from which he purchased the skates, he cannot hold Skatz liable."
					],
					"correct": 0,
					"explanation": "(MEDIUM) Answer (A) is correct. This is manufacturing defect case. Under the Restatement and the law as it has developed in all jurisdictions, such cases may be brought on a strict liability theory. Section 2 of the Third Restatement provides that a product \"contains a manufacturing defect when the product departs from its intended design even though all possible care was exercised in the preparation and marketing of the product.\" Thus, all Greg will need to prove is that the skate left the hands of Skatz with a deviation from its design that caused him harm.<br /><br />Answer (B) is incorrect because Skatz will be held strictly liable even if it would not be economically feasible for it to institute additional quality control procedures that would have caught this defect. This is the essence of strict liability in the present context.<br /><br />Answer (C) is incorrect because it does not matter that Skatz uses quality control measures that exceed reasonable care. It is strictly liable for a manufacturing defect.<br /><br />Answer (D) is incorrect because the law permits an injured person to recover from any seller along the chain of production, including the original manufacturer. Of course, if a product has been altered before it reaches the plaintiff, entities earlier in the chain might not be liable for the alteration (though sometimes they are responsible), but that is not the case here in any event. When the skate left Skatz's hands, it was in a defective condition. Skatz is liable even though others, such as the store from which Greg bought the skates, might also be liable."
