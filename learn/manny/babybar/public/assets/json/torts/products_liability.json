The crate in which the manufacturer shipped the range carried a warning label that the stove would tip over with a weight of 25 pounds or more on the oven door. The widow has one child, aged 3. Recently, the child was playing on the floor of the kitchen while the widow was heating water in a pan on the stove. When the widow left the kitchen for a moment, the child opened the oven door and climbed on it to see what was in the pan.

Although the manufacture of explosives may be an abnormally dangerous activity, strict liability for injuries caused by such activities is limited to the kind of harm that makes the activity abnormally dangerous.

This answer correctly concludes that the driver is not likely to prevail, but it misstates the reasoning for this conclusion. The fact that the windstorm was unusually severe may be relevant to a negligence claim, where the case would turn on whether the owner took reasonable precautions to prevent the accident, but it is not relevant to a claim of strict liability. The strict liability claim fails because the risk that materialized was not of the sort that makes the activity abnormally dangerous. <br /> <br /> Answer D is incorrect. Strict liability is based on the abnormally dangerous nature of the activity and is limited to the realization of the kind of harm that makes the activity abnormally dangerous. The inappropriateness of the activity to the place where it is carried on may be one factor in deciding whether the activity is abnormally dangerous, but it is not the only factor.

During an unusually heavy windstorm, a large tile was blown off the roof of the plant and crashed into a passing car, damaging the hood and the windshield. The driver of the car brought a strict liability action against the owner of the plant to recover for the damage to the car. <br /> <br /> Is the driver likely to prevail?",
					"answerOptions": [
						"No, because the damage to the car did not result from the abnormally dangerous aspect of the plant's activity.",
						"No, because the severity of the windstorm was unusual.",
						"Yes, because the plant's activity was abnormally dangerous.",
						"Yes, because the plant's location near a busy highway was abnormally dangerous."
					],
					"correct": 0,
					"explanation": "Answer A is correct. Although the manufacture of explosives may be an abnormally dangerous activity, strict liability for injuries caused by such activities is limited to the kind of harm that makes the activity abnormally dangerous. This accident could have occurred when a roof tile fell from a building that housed a perfectly safe and ordinary activity. The owner may, however, be liable for negligence. Thus, Answer A is correct and Answer C is incorrect. <br /> <br /> Answer B is incorrect. This answer correctly concludes that the driver is not likely to prevail, but it misstates the reasoning for this conclusion. The fact that the windstorm was unusually severe may be relevant to a negligence claim, where the case would turn on whether the owner took reasonable precautions to prevent the accident, but it is not relevant to a claim of strict liability. The strict liability claim fails because the risk that materialized was not of the sort that makes the activity abnormally dangerous. <br /> <br /> Answer D is incorrect. Strict liability is based on the abnormally dangerous nature of the activity and is limited to the realization of the kind of harm that makes the activity abnormally dangerous. The inappropriateness of the activity to the place where it is carried on may be one factor in deciding whether the activity is abnormally dangerous, but it is not the only factor. In this case, strict liability would not be applicable even if the plant were located in a heavily traveled area, because the harm that occurred was not related to the dangerous nature of the plant's activity."

Any user who is injured by a defective product can bring a products liability claim based on strict liability in tort as long as they can satisfy the requirements for the prima facie case. The four elements of the case are: (1) a strict duty owed by a commercial supplier, (2) breach of that duty, (3) actual and proximate causation, and (4) damages. In a products liability claim, the main difference between a negligence and strict liability claim is that the negligence standard of care is replaced with an absolute duty to make safe. In a strict liability case, the plaintiff need only prove that the product was unreasonably dangerous to show a breach of duty. Thus, in contrast to a negligence action, a retailer in a strict liability action may be liable simply because it was a commercial supplier of a defective product.<br /> <br /> Additionally, in a strict liability claim, the product must be expected to, and must in fact, reach the user or consumer without substantial change in the condition in which it is supplied.

The college student's roommate asked to use the No-Flake, and college student said, \"Be careful not to use too much.\" The roommate thereafter used No-Flake twice a day, applying two or three capfuls each time, notwithstanding the label statement that read: \"Use no more than one capful per day. See box instructions.\" The more he used No-Flake, the more inflamed his scalp became, the more it itched, and the more he used.<br /> <br /> After three weeks of such use, the roommate finally consulted a doctor who diagnosed his problem as a serious and irreversible case of dermatitis caused by excessive exposure to the active ingredients by No-Flake. These ingredients are uniquely effective at controlling dandruff, but there is no way to remove a remote risk to a small percentage of persons who may contract dermatitis as the result of applying, for prolonged periods of time, amounts of No-Flake substantially in excess of the directions.

Thus, in contrast to a negligence action, a retailer in a strict liability action may be liable simply because it was a commercial supplier of a defective product.<br /> <br /> Additionally, in a strict liability claim, the product must be expected to, and must in fact, reach the user or consumer without substantial change in the condition in which it is supplied. In this case, since the college student removed and disposed of the box containing the adequate warning before the shampoo reached the roommate, the product was substantially changed from the condition in which it was sold, and there is not adequate causation to sustain the roommate's claim.<br /> <br /> Answer A is incorrect. The roommate's misuse of the product would not provide a defense to a strict liability action in a jurisdiction that maintains traditional contributory negligence rules. Even if the misuse rose to the level that the roommate was contributorily negligent, this is not a defense where the plaintiff simply failed to recognize the danger or guard against its existence. Therefore, B is also incorrect. Answer C is incorrect because privity is not required in a products liability claim based on strict liability, the injured party must only be a foreseeable user. Thus, A, B, and C are incorrect while D is the correct answer choice."

					],
					"correct": 1,
					"explanation": "Answer B is correct. A product is defective if it fails to include a feasible safety device that would prevent injuries foreseeably incurred in ordinary use. Offering the safety device as an alternative is not adequate; in fact, it indicates that the company had reason to foresee that the press, if used without a safety device, would pose a significant risk to those who operated it. Here, there was a feasible safety device that would have prevented the worker's injury. The company sold two kinds of presses--one with a safety device and another without the safety device. The model without the safety device was sold at a slightly reduced price, indicating that it was feasible to include the safety device for a small price. Furthermore, the safety device would have prevented the injury to the worker's hand. Accordingly, the product was defective because it was sold without a safety device.<br /> <br /> Answer A is incorrect. This answer correctly states that the worker would likely prevail, but it misstates the legal basis for this conclusion. The fact that a product manufactured by the company caused harm to the worker is not sufficient to establish liability. In addition, the worker must prove that the press was either negligently made or defective in order to recover from the company.<br /> <br /> Answer C is incorrect. The possibility that an employer would purchase the press without a safety device in order to save money is not only foreseeable but known to have occurred here, and it is precisely this possibility that should have led the company to install a safety device that could not be removed. Offering the safety device as an alternative is not adequate; in fact, it indicates that the company had reason to foresee that the press, if used without a safety device, would pose a significant risk to those who operated it. <br /> <br /> Answer D is incorrect. Where it is feasible to install a safety device, a manufacturer does not fulfill its obligation to make a safe product by warning the purchaser that the product is unsafe. Offering the safety device as an alternative is not adequate; in fact, it indicates that the company had reason to foresee that the press, if used without a safety device, would pose a significant risk to those who operated it."

The company extensively tested ZB for several years on animals and human volunteers and had observed no undesirable side effects. The Federal Drug Administration (FDA) then approved ZB for sale as a prescription drug.<br /> <br /> Five other drug companies, each acting independently, developed drugs identical to ZB. Each of these drugs was also approved by the FDA for sale as a prescription drug. A wholesaler bought identically-shaped pills from all six of the manufacturers and sold the pills to drugstores as Wegener's X.<br /> <br /> This drug had a long-delayed side effect. Sons of male users of Wegener's X are sterile. One such son brought an action against the drug company for his damages.

					"question": "A college student purchased a large bottle of No-Flake dandruff shampoo, manufactured by a shampoo company. The box containing the bottle stated in part: \"CAUTION--Use only 1 capful at most once a day. Greater use may cause severe damage to the scalp.\" The college student read the writing on the box, removed the bottle, and threw the box away. The college student's roommate asked to use the No-Flake, and college student said, \"Be careful not to use too much.\" The roommate thereafter used No-Flake twice a day, applying two or three capfuls each time, notwithstanding the label statement that read: \"Use no more than one capful per day. See box instructions.\" The more he used No-Flake, the more inflamed his scalp became, the more it itched, and the more he used.<br /> <br /> After three weeks of such use, the roommate finally consulted a doctor who diagnosed his problem as a serious and irreversible case of dermatitis caused by excessive exposure to the active ingredients in No-Flake. These ingredients are uniquely effective at controlling dandruff, but there is no way to remove a remote risk to a small percentage of persons who may contract dermatitis as the result of applying, for prolonged periods of time, amounts of No-Flake substantially in excess of the directions. This jurisdiction adheres to the traditional common-law rules pertaining to contributory negligence and assumption of risk.<br /> <br /> Based upon the foregoing facts, if the roommate sues the shampoo company to recover damages for his dermatitis, his most promising theory of liability will be that the No-Flake shampoo",
					"answerOptions": [
						"had an unreasonably dangerous manufacturing defect.",
						"had an unreasonably dangerous design defect.",
						"was inherently dangerous.",
						"was inadequately labeled to warn of its dangers."
					],
					"correct": 3,
					"explanation": "D is the correct answer, and is reached by the process of elimination. A defective product is one that is in a defective condition that is unreasonably dangerous to consumers. A product has an unreasonably dangerous manufacturing defect when the product is dangerous beyond the expectations of the ordinary consumer because of a departure from its intended design. The shampoo used by the roommate was made in conformity with the intended design, so A is incorrect.<br /> <br /> A product has a design defect when the plaintiff can show that a less dangerous modification or alternative was economically feasible. No such showing has been made by the roommate or suggested by the facts, so B is incorrect.<br /> <br /> C is incorrect because strict liability cannot be applied here due to the substantial altering of the packaging by the college student before it reached the roommate. Furthermore, the minimal risk does not outweigh the benefits of the product. Because A, B, and C are all inapplicable causes of action, the inadequate warning cause of action, though weak, is still the most promising theory of liability for the friend."
