			"description": "This is a defective design case. For strict liability to apply in defective design, the plaintiff must prevail in a risk-utility balancing test where the child must show that the risk and severity of her injuries were predictable to her as a small child. In some jurisdictions, the court would then consider the feasibility of alternative designs. Other jurisdictions shift the burden to the defendant (once plaintiff proves causation) requiring the manufacturer to show that the utility of the design outweighs the inherent danger. A warning does not need to be verbal. (Ref 159)",

					"question": "A widow recently purchased a new uncrated electric range for her kitchen from a local retailer. The range has a wide oven with a large oven door. The crate in which the manufacturer shipped the range carried a warning label that the stove would tip over with a weight of 25 pounds or more on the oven door. The widow has one child, aged 3. Recently, the child was playing on the floor of the kitchen while the widow was heating water in a pan on the stove. When the widow left the kitchen for a moment, the child opened the oven door and climbed on it to see what was in the pan. The child's weight (25 pounds) on the door caused the stove to tip over forward. The child fell to the floor and the hot water spilled over her, burning her severely. The widow ran to the kitchen and immediately gave her first aid treatment for burns. The child thereafter received medical treatment.<br /> <br /> The child's burns were painful. They have now healed and do not bother her, but she has ugly scars on her legs and back. The child's claim is asserted on her behalf by the proper party.<br /> <br /> If the child asserts a claim based on strict liability against the manufacturer, she must establish that",
					"answerOptions": [
						"the defendant negligently designed the stove.",
						"stoves made by other manufacturers do not turn over with a 25-pound weight on the oven door.",
						"the defendant failed to warn the widow and her that the stove would turn over easily.",
						"the stove was defective and unreasonably dangerous to her."
					],
					"correct": 3,
					"explanation": "D is the correct answer and can be reached by the process of elimination. The facts indicate that the stove arrived exactly as it was designed. This is a defective design case. For strict liability to apply in defective design, the plaintiff must prevail in a risk-utility balancing test where the child must show that the risk and severity of her injuries were predictable to her as a small child. In some jurisdictions, the court would then consider the feasibility of alternative designs. Other jurisdictions shift the burden to the defendant (once plaintiff proves causation) requiring the manufacturer to show that the utility of the design outweighs the inherent danger. A warning does not need to be verbal.<br /> <br /> The stove came with a written warning, so C can be eliminated. The risk-utility test is similar to the negligence standard but, since the question states the claim theory, answer A can be eliminated as an inappropriate standard. The presence of other stoves in the industry that do not tip with 25 pounds of weight would be part of the determination of the feasibility of other, safer designs, so \"B\" is not the best answer. D is the most complete response and states the rule rather than applicable facts. A, B and C are incorrect."
