	"conclusion": "Therefore, under comparative negligence theory, Plaintiff's recovery is reduced based on his fault percentage.",
	"description": "Comparative negligence places economic burdens on each party  in proportion to their percentage of fault. If a plaintiff suffers $100,000 worth of injury and the jury finds that defendant was 80% at fault and the plaintiff was 20% at fault, the plaintiff would recover $80,000 of her damages. Now here we have 2 types conttributory negligence. A. Pure Comparative Negligence, B. Partial Comparative Negligence.",

			"explanation": "Under tort law, in Contributory Negligence, plaintiff is barred from recovery if he <b>acted negligently</b> and helped to cause the accident.<br /><br />Here Heena acted <b>Negligently</b> because she was driving her car at 100 mph. Also Heena helped to <b>cause accident</b> because she was speeding her car and Amar's car cuts her off which causes accident. If she would be driving at slow speed, then accident could have been avoided.<br /><br />Therefore, under contributory negligence theory, Heena will be barred of any recovery."
