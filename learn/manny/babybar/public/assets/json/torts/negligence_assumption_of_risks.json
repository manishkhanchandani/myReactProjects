Before allowing the woman to bowl, the instructor required her to sign a waiver explicitly stating that she assumed all risk of injuries that she might suffer in connection with the class, including injuries due to negligence or any other fault. After she signed the waiver, the woman was injured when the instructor negligently dropped a bowling ball on the woman's foot. <br /><br />The woman brought a negligence action against the instructor. The instructor has filed a motion for summary judgment based on the waiver. <br /><br />What is the woman's best argument in opposition to the instructor's motion?",
