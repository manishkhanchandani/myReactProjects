	"rule": "Under contract law if a party performs a contractual duty that is subject to a condition precedent at a time the condition fails to hold, the party WAIVES THE CONDITION. But after a condition has been waived the waiving party has a legal right to retract the waiver. Nevertheless, a Court of EQUITY may estop the retraction based on considerations of equitable estoppel.",

			"name": "Rule 1: Waiver of Condition & Consideration",
			"description": "Under UCC, consideration is not required for a valid waiver. For example A has to deliver something to B on date X, and A orally agrees with B to change the date to Y, Here B waived a non-material term of the agreement and it is valid waiver without consideration.  Under UCC statute of frauds, goods above $500 required signed writing in order to enforce the contract.",

					"question": "On July 15, in a writing signed by both parties, a fixture company agreed to deliver to a druggist on August 15 five storage cabinets from inventory for a total price of $5,000 to be paid on delivery. On August 1, the two parties orally agreed to postpone the delivery date to August 20. On August 20, the fixture company tendered the cabinets to the druggist, who refused to accept or pay for them on the ground that they were not tendered on August 15, even though they otherwise met the contract specifications. Assuming that all appropriate defenses are seasonably raised, will the fixture company succeed in an action against the druggist for breach of contract?",
					"answerOptions": [
						"Yes, because neither the July 15 agreement nor the August 1 agreement was required to be in writing.",
						"Yes, because the August 1 agreement operated as a waiver of the August 15 delivery term.",
						"No, because there was no consideration to support the August 1 agreement.",
						"No, because the parol evidence rule will prevent proof of the August 1 agreement."
					],
					"correct": 1,
					"explanation": "Answer B is correct. A waiver is an excuse of the nonoccurrence or delay of a condition to fulfill a duty. Under the UCC, consideration is not required for a valid waiver. When the fixture company and the druggist agreed to postpone their delivery date under the contract from August 15 to August 20, in effect the druggist waived a non-material term of the agreement and the waiver was enforceable even without consideration. The druggist, therefore, was not justified in refusing to accept or to pay for the cabinets.<br /><br />A is incorrect because the July 15 agreement falls within the UCC Statute of Frauds, which requires a signed writing in order to enforce a contract for the sale of goods of $500 or more. C is incorrect because the waiver did not require consideration to be effective. D is incorrect because the parol evidence rule does not apply to promises made after the adoption of a final written contract."
