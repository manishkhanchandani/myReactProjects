Then the condition is called an EXPRESS CONDITION, and typically the contract says, \"Time is of the essence\".<br /><br />But material conditions may also be or implied when the parties knew at the time of execution that tardy performance would deny the non-performing party the BENEFIT OF THE BARGAIN, the benefit expected when they entered into the agreement. In that case the condition is called an IMPLIED MATERIAL CONDITION.",
