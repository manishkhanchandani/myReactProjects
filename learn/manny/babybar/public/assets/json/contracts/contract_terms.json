					"question": "Paul painted Elwood’s house. Elwood agreed to pay Paul “standard rates” for his services. After painting was completed, Paul and Elwood executed the following written document: “In exchange for Paul’s prior services in painting his house, Elwood, a licensed electrician, agrees to rewire Paul’s house. Paul hereby releases any claim he may have against Elwood for the unpaid painting bill.” Elwood started work on Paul’s house but skipped town without finishing. The house was not inhabitable and Paul had to pay another electrician $2,000 to finish it. If Paul sues Elwood for breach of contract, which of the following will be the court’s decision?",
					"ansOptions": [
						"Paul can recover for Elwood’s breach of a valid agreement made in settlement and discharge of an unliquidated claim by Paul against Elwood for Paul’s prior painting services.",
						"Paul can only recover for Elwood’s breach of promise under the doctrine of promissory estoppel because there was no bargained for consideration for Elwood’s promise.",
						"Paul cannot recover more than nominal damages in any event, because his other damages, if any, were speculative.",
						"Paul cannot recover because Elwood’s promise to rewire Paul’s house was given in substance, if not in form, for Paul’s past services."
					],
					"correct": 0,
					"explanation": "(A) Clearly Elwood and Paul created a contract with an open (uncertain) term, the price Elwood had to pay Paul. That could have caused a problem but they settled that uncertainty by agreement after the fact. The second agreement is not a modification of the first contract. Rather it is a second contract to settle the uncertainty of the first contract. [See “Simple Contracts & UCC Outline”, reasonable certainty of terms, p. 2.] (C) is wrong because their second contract established what Elwood owed Paul, ending any possible “speculation”. (D) is wrong because the phrase “in substance, but not form” is simply nonsense meaning nothing. (B) is wrong because their second agreement is a valid contract and “promissory estoppel” is only an equitable remedy that cannot be awarded unless there is no legally enforceable contract in the first place. [See “Simple Contracts & UCC Outline”, promissory estoppel, p. 96.] Everything (A) states is true, so it is the right answer."

			"description": "When parties attach different meaning to same material term, then meaning that controls the contract will be the one which is decided at the time of agreement of the contract. And if both party means different meaning and one party (B) knows the exact meaning of another party (A) then contract is formed based on what A thinks.  For example if A means blue color and B means red color, but B knows that A means blue color, so contract is formed based on what A thinks.",

					"question": "An innkeeper, who had no previous experience in the motel or commercial laundry business and who knew nothing about the trade usages of either business, bought a motel and signed an agreement with a laundry company for the motel's laundry services. The agreement was for a term of one year and provided for \"daily service at $500 a week.\" From their conversations during negotiation, the laundry company owner knew that the innkeeper expected laundry services seven days a week. When the laundry company refused to pick up the motel's laundry on two successive Sundays and indicated that it would never do so, the innkeeper canceled the agreement. The laundry company sued the innkeeper for breach of contract. At trial, clear evidence was introduced to show that in the commercial laundry business \"daily service\" did not include service on Sundays. Is the laundry company likely to succeed in its action?",
					"ansOptions": [
						"No, because the laundry company knew the meaning the innkeeper attached to \"daily service\", and, therefore the innkeeper's meaning will control.",
						"No, because the parties attached materially different meanings to \"daily service\", and therefore no contract was formed.",
						"Yes, because the parol evidence rule will not permit the innkeeper to prove the meaning she attached to \"daily service.\"",
						"Yes, because the trade usage will control the interpretation of \"daily service.\""
					],
					"correct": 0,
					"explanation": "Answer A is correct. When parties attach significantly different meanings to the same material term, the meaning that controls is that \"attached by one of them if at the time the agreement was made . . . that party did not know of any different meaning attached by the other, and the other knew the meaning attached by the first party.\" Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 201. In this case, the innkeeper did not know, at the time of contract formation, that the laundry company attached a different meaning to the term \"daily service\" than its apparent meaning of \"every day.\" Conversely, the laundry company knew the innkeeper thought he was contracting for \"every day\" service. Accordingly, the innkeeper's understanding of the term will control.<br /><br />Answer B is incorrect. While it is sometimes the case that no agreement arises when parties attach significantly different meanings to the same material term, that principle is not applicable when, as here, one of the parties is aware of the meaning intended by the other. Thus, a contract was formed despite the fact that the parties attached different meanings to \"daily service.\" As explained above, the laundry service knowingly attached a different meaning to \"daily service,\" and the innkeeper's understanding of the term will control.<br /><br />Answer C is incorrect. The parol evidence rule is not applicable here. The apparent meaning of \"daily service\" is \"every day.\" This is the meaning asserted by the innkeeper, and so it is not the innkeeper that is seeking to alter the apparent meaning of the term, but rather the laundry company. That is, to the extent that there is extrinsic evidence here, it is not being offered by the innkeeper, but rather by the laundry company. As explained above, the innkeeper's understanding of the term \"daily service\" will control.<br /><br />Answer D is incorrect. While it is often the case that trade usages control the interpretation of terms in a contract, that is not true here. As explained above, the innkeeper's understanding of the term \"daily service\" will control because the laundry company knew that the innkeeper was not aware of the trade usage."
