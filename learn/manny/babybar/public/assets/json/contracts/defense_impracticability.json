					"question": "65. A photographer and a customer entered a contract in writing on November 1, the essential part of which read as follows: \"[the photographer] to supply the customer with 200 personalized Christmas cards on or before December 15, bearing a photograph of [the customer] and his family, and [the customer] to pay $100 thirty days thereafter. Photograph to be taken by [the photographer] at [the customer]'s house. Cards guaranteed to be fully satisfactory and on time.\" Because the customer suddenly became ill, the photographer was unable to take the necessary photograph of the customer and his family until the first week of December. The final week's delay was caused by the photographer's not being notified promptly by the customer of his recovery. Before taking the photograph of the customer and his family, the photographer advised the customer that he was likely to be delayed a day or two beyond December 15 in making delivery because of the time required to process the photograph and cards. The customer told the photographer to take the photograph anyway. The cards were finally delivered by the photographer to the customer on December 17, the photographer having diligently worked on them in the interim. Although the cards pleased the rest of the family, the customer refused to accept them because, as he said squinting at one of the cards at arm's length without bothering to put on his reading glasses, \"The photograph makes me look too old. Besides, the cards weren't delivered on time.\"<br /><br />Which of the following statements regarding the legal effect of the customer's illness is LEAST accurate?",
					"answerOptions": [
						"The customer's illness and the related development excused the photographer from his obligations to deliver the cards on or before December 15.",
						"Prompt notice by the customer to the photographer of the customer's recovery from illness was an implied condition of the photographer's duty under the circumstances.",
						"The photographer was under a duty of immediate performance of his promise to deliver the cards, as of December 15, by reason of the express language of the contract and despite the illness of the customer and the related developments.",
						"The customer's conduct after his illness constituted a waiver of the necessity of the photographer's performing on or before December 15."
					],
					"correct": 2,
					"explanation": "Answer C is correct. Where the existence of a particular person is necessary for the performance of a duty, his incapacity, if sufficient to make performance impracticable, may operate to excuse performance of the contract. If the delay resulting from the impracticability is not material, it may operate to suspend but not discharge the parties' remaining obligations under the contract. Since the contract between the customer and the photographer required the photographer to take a photograph of \"[the customer] and his family,\" the customer's availability was necessary for the performance of the photographer's duty and therefore his illness excused the photographer's delay in completing the cards by the December 15 due date. Since the photographer had no way of knowing of the customer's recovery, his obligation to resume performance was conditioned upon receiving notice of it. Although the customer might have taken the position that the delay beyond December was material, thereby justifying the discharge of any further obligation, his conduct (informing the photographer to \"take the photograph anyway\") amounted to a waiver of the December 15 deadline. Answer C is the least accurate statement since, as explained above, the customer's illness provided a basis for excuse of the delay."
