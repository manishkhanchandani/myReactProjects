	"rule": "Under contract law an OFFER is a manifestation of present contractual intent communicated to the offeree such that an objective person would reasonably believe assent would form a bargain. <br /><br />If ONLY common law go on to say, At common law a communication was only deemed sufficient to constitute an offer if it specified the parties, subject matter, quantity, price, and time of performance.<br /><br />If UCC say, The UCC deems a communication sufficient to constitute an offer if it specifies the parties and quantity. The UCC provides \"GAP FILLERS\" that may be used by the Court to determine any additional terms.",
	"description": "Advertisements are generally not offers because they usually fail to identify the parties or the quantity being offered. <br /><br />You can add contract terms in the offer or you can create a separate issue for contract terms where you can mention quantity, price, subject, time, parties.",
