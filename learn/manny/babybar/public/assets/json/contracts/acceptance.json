			"description": "Under the UCC, an order to buy goods \"for prompt shipment\" is interpreted as inviting acceptance either by a prompt promise to ship or by a prompt shipment of conforming or non-conforming goods. Where the goods delivered fail to conform to the contract, the buyer may reject the goods if the rejection is made within a reasonable time after delivery. (Ref: 55)",

					"question": "55. A buyer ordered from a seller 500 bushels of No. 1 Royal Fuzz peaches, at a specified price, \"for prompt shipment.\" The seller promptly shipped 500 bushels, but by mistake shipped No. 2 Royal Fuzz peaches instead of No. 1. The error in shipment was caused by the negligence of the seller's shipping clerk.<br /><br />Which of the following best states the buyer's rights and duties upon delivery of the peaches?",
					"answerOptions": [
						"The seller's shipment of the peaches was a counteroffer and the buyer can refuse to accept them.",
						"The seller's shipment of the peaches was a counteroffer but, since peaches are perishable, the buyer, if it does not want to accept them, must reship the peaches to the seller in order to mitigate the seller's losses.",
						"The buyer must accept the peaches because a contract was formed when the seller shipped them.",
						"Although a contract was formed when the seller shipped the peaches, the buyer does not have to accept them."

					"subtopic": "Formation of Contracts",
					"explanation": "Answer D is correct. Under the UCC, an order to buy goods \"for prompt shipment\" is interpreted as inviting acceptance either by a prompt promise to ship or by a prompt shipment of conforming or non-conforming goods. Where the goods delivered fail to conform to the contract, the buyer may reject the goods if the rejection is made within a reasonable time after delivery. When the buyer ordered 500 bushels of peaches \"for prompt shipment,\" the seller accepted by shipping No. 2 (rather than No. 1) Royal Fuzz peaches, and therefore the buyer has the right to reject them. Answers A and B are incorrect because the prompt shipment will be interpreted as an acceptance even if the goods are non-conforming. Answer C is incorrect because although a contract was formed, the buyer has the right to reject non-conforming goods."
