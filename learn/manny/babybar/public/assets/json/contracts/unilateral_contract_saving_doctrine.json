	"rule": "Under the common law an offeror could revoke her offer at any time before acceptance. Under that view Fester could revoke at any time, leaving Dottie without a remedy. Modernly SAVING DOCTRINES have been adopted to prohibit the offeror of a unilateral contract from revoking for a reasonable time after becoming aware that the offeree has begun performance in acceptance.<br /><br />Under an alternative view the offeror may revoke but the offeree has a right to RESTITUTION to avoid UNJUST ENRICHMENT.",
