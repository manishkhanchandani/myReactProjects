			"essay": "Debbie and Jon met in college and dated each other for two years. Debbie loved Jon very much and wanted to marry him. Jon always told her that he loved only her, but he told her he thought they were too young and should not rush into marriage.<br /><br /> One day as Debbie was putting gasoline into her car at the gasoline station, she looked into the car parked next to hers. She was enraged to see her best friend Vickie passionately kissing Jon. Debbie walked over to the car, with the fuel dispenser in her hand, and started yelling at Vickie and Jon. Vickie said, \"I'm sorry you had to find out this way. Jon and I love each other and are going to get married.\"<br /><br /> Debbie was enraged and shouted, \"You're not going to marry anyone, you slime!\" She then pointed the gasoline dispenser at Vickie and sprayed her with gasoline, soaking her hair and clothes. Jon reached over to try to help Vickie. Unfortunately, he was smoking a cigarette. The cigarette ignited the gasoline and Vickie burned to death.<br /><br /> What offense or offenses has Debbie committed and what defenses, if any, would she assert? Discuss.",
			"sampleAnswers": [
				"<b>1) Assault</b> <br /><br />An assault is an act which causes an immediate apprehension of a harmful or offensive contact.<br /><br /> In this case, the state may argue that when Debbie pointed the gasoline dispenser at Vickie, while shouting at her, Vickie could have reasonably apprehended an unlawful and offensive contact, i.e., being sprayed with gasoline. <br /><br />Debbie has committed an assault.<br /><br /><b>2) Battery </b><br /><br />Battery is an act which causes a person to suffer a harmful or offensive contact.<br /><br /> The state may argue that spraying Vickie with gasoline, soaking her hair and clothes, constituted a harmful and offensive contact.<br /><br /> Debbie has committed a battery, but it will merge with the crimes discussed below.<br /><br /><b>3) Homicide</b><br /><br /> Homicide is the death of a human being, which is caused by another human being.<br /><br /> In this case, Vickie was burned to death, so there is a death of a human being.<br /><br /> <b>4) Actual Cause</b><br /><br /> But for Debbie's act of spraying Vickie with gasoline, she would not have been burned to death, so Debbie is the actual cause.<br /><br /> <b>5) Proximate Cause</b><br /><br /> The state will argue that a personal being burned to death is the foreseeable result of spraying them with gasoline.<br /><br /> Debbie will argue that it was Jon's cigarette that ignited her clothes, which constitutes an independent intervening act which broke the issue of causation.<br /><br /> Debbie's argument will fail, especially if she could in some way tell that Jon was smoking a cigarette, i.e., saw smoke or smelled smoke.<br /><br /> Debbie is the proximate cause of Vickie's death, and is therefore responsible for her homicide.<br /><br /> <b>6) Murder</b><br /><br /> Murder is an unsuccessful homicide, with malice aforethought. Malice is established by showing:<br /><br /> 1) An intent to kill, or<br /><br /> 2) An intent to cause great bodily injury, or<br /><br /> 3) The death resulted from an awareness of and conscious disregard for a high risk to human life, or<br /><br /> 4) The death resulted during the commission of an inherently dangerous felony.<br /><br /> There is a homicide as discussed above. In this case, the state may argue that when Debbie yelled, \"You're not marrying anyone, you slime,\" and then sprayed Vickie with gasoline, she demonstrated an intent to kill, or an intent to cause great bodily harm.<br /><br /> The state may also argue that by spraying gasoline onto a person, Debbie demonstrated an awareness of and disregard for a high risk to human life (Depraved Heart).<br /><br /> The state will be able to establish malice.<br /><br /> <b>7) First Degree Murder/Second Degree Murder</b><br /><br /> Murder that is willful, deliberate and premeditated is First Degree Murder, Second Degree is other types of murder.<br /><br /> If the state can convince a jury that in the brief seconds between seeing Jon and Vickie and spraying her with gas, Debbie decided to kill her, They will establish First Degree Murder.<br /><br /> The state will have a difficult time showing that Debbie reflected upon her act, so she has probably committed second degree murder under a depraved heart theory.<br /><br /><b>8) Voluntary Manslaughter</b><br /><br /> Voluntary manslaughter is an intentional killing of a human being, where malice is mitigated by adequate provocation.<br /><br /> To be adequate, the provocation must be sufficient to enrage the passion of a reasonable person, and the defendant must actually be provoked.<br /><br /> Additionally, there must not have been enough time for a reasonable person to \"cool\" down, and the defendant must not have actually \"cooled\" down.<br /><br /> If the state cannot prove murder, it may argue that Debbie intended to kill Vickie, but that she was provoked by seeing Jon and Vickie passionately kissing in the car next to her. Seeing a boyfriend kiss your best friend is sufficient to enrage the passion of a reasonable person, so Debbie's provocation is reasonable.<br /><br />Additionally there was a break in time between Debbie witnessing the incident and her actions so she did not cool down, nor is there sufficient time for a reasonable person to cool down.<br /><br /> Debbie has committed voluntary manslaughter, if the state can show an intent to kill.<br /><br /><b>9) Involuntary Manslaughter</b><br /><br /> Involuntary manslaughter is an unintended homicide that results from criminal negligence, or the commission of an unlawful act, not amounting to an inherently dangerous felony.<br /><br /> Debbie may argue that at most she has committed an involuntary manslaughter, because she did not intend to kill Vickie, and that Vickie's death resulted from Debbie's criminal negligence or the commission of a battery.<br /><br /> If Debbie did not intend to kill, she may have committed an involuntary manslaughter.<br /><br /><b>10) Attempted murder - Jon</b><br /><br /> An attempt is a substantial step beyond preparation toward the commission of a crime, with the specific intent that the crime be committed. The state may argue that when Debbie sprayed gas on Vickie, while Jon was seated next to her, smoking a cigarette, she took a substantial step toward killing Jon also.<br /><br /> However, there are no facts to suggest that Debbie intended to kill Jon, so the state will not be able to prove an attempted murder of Jon.",
				"State vs. Debbie<br /><br /> State could charge Debbie for criminal assault, battery, and murder (with possibility of first degree murder) as well as involuntary manslaughter.<br /><br /> <b>Murder</b><br /><br /> Issue - <b>Can Debbie be charged with murder of Vickie</b>?<br /><br /> Under criminal law, murder is unlawful homicide, killing of a human being by another, with malice aforethought.<br /><br /> Malice can be found if there is (1) intent to kill, (2) intent to cause great bodily injury, (3) commission of a dangerous felony, felony murder rule, and (4) act with awareness of and disregard for the unjustified risk to human life. The depraved heart murder rule.<br /><br /> Here, this is a killing because Vickie, a human being, died due to the act of another human being, Debbie. The killing is unlawful because it is not justified.<br /><br /> Here malice can also be found because Debbie pointed the gasoline dispenser at Vickie and \"sprayed\" gas on her. This act can be construed as \"intent to kill\" because gasoline is a dangerous substance and everyone knows it would cause death if ignited. Also, there is an intent to cause great injury because even if not ignited, the chemical feature would cause injury to the people.<br /><br /> Therefore Debbie can be charged with murder of Vickie.<br /><br /> Further, if Debbie's act can be construed as deliberated and premeditated, she could also be charged with \"First degree murder.\"<br /><br /> <b>Causation</b><br /><br /> Under criminal, the death of the victim must be <b>actually</b> and <b>proximately</b> caused by defendant's act.<br /><br /> <b>Actual causation</b> is determined by \"but for \" test. Here, but for Debbie's act, Vickie would not have died. Therefore she actually caused Vickie's death.<br /><br /> <b>Proximate causation</b> is determined when the result is foreseeable and there is no superseding intervening event to break the chain of causation. Here, Debbie could argue that Jon's smoking of a cigarette is a superseding event and therefore had broken the chain of causation. However, State would argue that Jon's smoking is foreseeable even if it was unreasonable and spraying gasoline on a person could cause death is also foreseeable.<br /><br /> Therefore, Debbie both actually and proximately caused death of Vickie. Therefore Debbie can be charged with murder.<br /><br /><b>Battery</b><br /><br /> Can Debbie be charged with criminal battery?<br /><br /> Under criminal law, battery is intentional causing harmful or offensive touching.<br /><br /> Here there is an intentional act because Debbie \"sprayed\" gasoline on Vickie. There is also a touching, because gas was put on Vickie by Debbie. There is also a harmful and offensive touching because gasoline is dangerous and [to] be sprayed in public is offensive.<br /><br /> Therefore, Debbie can be charged with Battery.<br /><br /><b>Assault</b><br /><br /> Issue - <b>Can Debbie be charged with criminal assault?</b><br /><br /> Under criminal law, assault can be either attempted battery or attempt to cause apprehension of a battery.<br /><br /> Here, there is an attempt to cause apprehension because Debbie \"shouted\" with \"gasoline dispenser in her hand.\" This would cause a reasonable person to apprehend an offensive or harmful touching.<br /><br /> Therefore, Debbie can be charged with criminal assault.<br /><br /><b>Involuntary Manslaughter</b><br /><br /> Issue - <b>Debbie can be charged with involuntary manslaughter?</b><br /><br /> Under criminal law, involuntary manslaughter is an unintentional killing without malice aforethought done with criminal negligence. Gross reckless or killing during a malum in se felony is not enough to charge for felony murder.<br /><br /> Here, Debbie could also be charged for involuntary manslaughter because her conduct is grossly reckless, i.e., spraying gasoline on another person and caused death.<br /><br /> Therefore, Debbie can be charged with involuntary manslaughter.<br /><br /><b>Defenses</b><br /><br /><b>Mitigation</b><br /><br />Issue - <b>Can Debbie mitigate her killing to voluntary Manslaughter</b> by claiming provocation?<br /><br /> Under criminal law, voluntary manslaughter is an intentional killing without malice aforethought done with adequate provocation: (1) Provoked if it is a reasonable person. (2) Defendant provoked. (3) Not time for cooling down. (4) Defendant did not cool down.<br /><br /> Here, Debbie would argue that she was provoked because she saw Vickie \"passionately kissing\" Jon, Debbie's boyfriend, and she was \"enraged\" to see this. There is also no time to cool down because it happened when Debbie was adding gas, a very short period of time.<br /><br /> Therefore, Debbie would be successful to claim \"heated passion\" killing and mitigate her crime down from murder to voluntary manslaughter.<br /><br /><b>Insanity</b><br /><br /> Under criminal law, insanity is a defense if it negates a required mental state element of the crime charged. Under M'Naghten test, if due to mental disease the defendant did not know what she was doing was wrong, she could be found insane. Under irresistible impulse test, if defendant knew what she was doing was wrong but could not stop herself she can be found insane.<br /><br /> Here, Debbie could claim that she was in \"shock\" and became \"temporarily insane\" and \"could not control herself when she did what she had done.\" However, there is unlikely [sic] she would be successful to raise this defense because there is [sic] no facts to support this claim.<br /><br /> Therefore, Debbie could not successfully use the defense of insanity."

			"essay": "Anna owned a business and stored insured business inventory at a warehouse owned by Bob. Anna was experiencing financial problems and needed funds to pay her creditors. Bob, after hearing of Anna's money problems, suggested that they hire someone to burn down the warehouse since he was planning to build condominiums on the warehouse property and could use the insurance proceeds for the construction of the condominiums. Bob told Anna that he knew someone who would handle burning the warehouse in return for a percentage of the insurance proceeds. Anna agreed and Bob contacted Cindy to burn down the warehouse. Cindy obtained the location of the warehouse from Bob and proceeded to set fire to the warehouse. Unbeknownst to Anna, Bob or Cindy, a homeless person, Daryll, was living in the warehouse. Daryll died as a result of the fire.<br /><br /> After hearing about Daryll's death, Anna and Bob decided not to make any insurance claims. After an investigation Anna, Bob and Cindy were arrested.<br /><br /> With what crimes, if any, might Anna, Bob and Cindy be charged and what defenses, if any, could each assert? Discuss.",
			"sampleAnswers": [
				"<b>I. Anna's Crimes</b><br /><br /><b> A. Conspiracy.</b><br /><br /> A Conspiracy is where two or more people agree/intend to commit an unlawful act and do something in furtherance of the act. Here, after hearing of Anna's money, Bob suggested that they hire someone to burn down the warehouse since Bob wanted to build condominiums on the warehouse property and they could both use the insurance proceeds. Their conspiracy was complete once Bob contacted Cindy to burn down the warehouse - they have now done an act of doing something in furtherance of their unlawful act. Both (sic) Bob, Anna and Cindy will be charged with conspiracy to burn down (arson) the warehouse.<br /><br /> <b>1 Pinkerton's Rule.</b> This rule states that all co-conspirators will be responsible for the unlawful acts of other co-conspirators done in furtherance of the conspiracy. Here, Anna will be held responsible for all acts done by Bob and Cindy to further their unlawful conspiracy.<br /><br /><b>B. Solicitation.</b><br /><br /> Solicitation is when one encourages, asks, incites another into committing an unlawful act. Here Anna would be charged with the solicitation of Cindy because Bob asked Cindy to burn down the warehouse. However, when Cindy agreed she then merged the crime of solicitation into conspiracy.<br /><br /><b>C. Attempted Insurance Fraud.</b> <br /><br />To be charged with the crime of attempt the defendant must specifically intend to commit the unlawful act and do something in furtherance to show that the defendant actually intended the crime. Here, Anna will be charged with the intent to commit insurance fraud. Because Anna and Bob agreed to commit arson in order to collect insurance money. The attempt will be considered complete when Bob asked Cindy to burn down the warehouse and Cindy set fire to the warehouse as instructed. Even though Anna and Bob decided not to make any insurance claims they will still be charged with attempted insurance fraud. It was because Daryll the homeless man was killed that they did not want anyone to be suspicious of them. And possible guilt of him dying that caused Anna and Bob to not go through with their insurance claims. Anna will be charged with attempt to commit insurance fraud.<br /><br /><b>D. Arson</b> is when the defendant intentionally burns down the house of another. Modernly, basically all structures are included, including one's own business or property in order to collect insurance money. The burning must be at least some type of charring to suffice, blackening will not. Here, Cindy set the fire to the warehouse and we assume that it was burned because it was significant enough to cause Daryll's death and burning also qualified because Anna and Bob could collect insurance claims. The burning of the warehouse was intentional as Anna and Bob conspired to have it burned down by asking Cindy to burn it down for a percentage of the insurance proceeds. Anna also burned her own property (business inventory) and the burning is supposed to be of another's property. However if one commits arson with the intention of collecting insurance money then this qualifies as arson because Anna did so for illegal purposes. She also destroyed other people's property that was destroyed in the warehouse.<br /><br /><b>E. Murder.</b> <br /><br />A homicide is the unlawful killing of another human being. It will be considered murder if malice is proved.<br /><br /> <b>1. Malice.</b> <br /><br />Malice will be proved if any of the following four elements are met: 1) intent to kill (premeditation and deliberation); 2) intent to seriously injure; 3) wanton and willful conduct (depraved heart); and 4) a killing done in connection with a dangerous felony . Here, the state would most likely focus on a killing done in connection with a dangerous felony as this element and intent to kill/murder the defendant is eligible for a first degree murder charge.<br /><br /> <b>2. Felony-Murder.</b> <br /><br />Felony murder is charged when the defendant kills another human being in the course of a dangerous felony. For a felony to qualify the felony must be considered extremely dangerous so as to show dangers to other people. Most jurisdictions list dangerous felonies as a killing during the commission of arson, rape, robbery, burglary or a kidnaping. It does not matter that you did not intend to kill another person but because of the dangerous situation involved in committing the felony a death could foreseeably occur because of the defendant's actions. Here, Anna conspired to commit the crime of arson, burning down the warehouse and by doing so she was committing a dangerous felony when Cindy went ahead and set fire to the warehouse. Because fire is considered dangerous, a chance of loss of life is easily foreseeable, then Anna will be charged with the felony murder of Daryll.<br /><br /><b>1. Involuntary manslaughter.</b> <br /><br />Anna will claim that by her planning to burn down the warehouse and Cindy burning it down that they did not intend that Daryll would die. That the fire was an act of criminal negligence and the felony-murder charge should be reduced to involuntary manslaughter. However, this is an unlikely defense because Anna planned on committing arson which qualifies as a dangerous felony because it was foreseeable that another person might be seriously injured or die because of their actions.<br /><br />II. <b>Bob's Crimes.</b><br /><br /> <b>A.

				"<b>People v. Anna</b><br /><br /> <b>Conspiracy Liability</b><br /><br /> At common law a conspiracy is an agreement between two or more persons to commit an overt illegal act or a legal act by illegal means. Modernly an overt act is required. The Warton rule requires one more person in the agreement than is necessary to commit the crime. A party may withdraw from a conspiracy provided the withdraw [sic] is done voluntary [sic] (without duress of immediate apprehension), is disclosed to all other parties of the conspiracy, and is in sufficient time before the crime is committed. A party to a conspiracy is liable for the foreseeable crimes committed by the other parties to the conspiracy prior to the withdrawal.<br /><br /> Here Bob and Anna formed an agreement because \"Anna agreed.\" The agreement was to burn down the warehouse, an arson. They committed an overt act by contracting with Cindy to burn down the building. Arson is the malicious burning of the dwelling of another. Modernly, the dwelling has been expanded to including most structures and other places, i.e. forest, etc. . . . Likewise the structure can be the defendant's own, if done with criminal intent, i.e., insurance fraud.<br /><br /> Therefore, Anna conspired with Bob to burn the warehouse with the intent of defrauding the insurance company. (At common law, the act of the arson would not be a crime since the structure was not a dwelling, but the intended result of insurance fraud would be a crime, supra, and therefore would still result in a conspiracy.<br /><br /> <b>CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT LARCENY/FRAUD</b><br /><br /> <b>Conspiracy</b>, defined supra.<br /><br /> Larceny is the trespasser taking and carrying away of the personal property of another with the intent to permanently deprive. Fraud is larceny by trick through misrepresentation of a fact to another to induce the other to give up personal property.<br /><br /> Here Anna (and Bob) intended to burn down the warehouse to collect upon Bob's insurance policy, the personal property of another, the insurance company. Anna agreed to the act. The intent was to defraud the insurance company, an illegal act. By contracting with Cindy an overt act was commenced.<br /><br /> Anna will be charged with Conspiracy to commit fraud.<br /><br /> <b>CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT SOLICITATION OF A CRIME</b><br /><br /> <b>Conspiracy</b>, defined supra.<br /><br /> Solicitation is the act of urging or encouraging another to commit a criminal act, with the intent of the act being committed. The solicitation can be of any criminal act.<br /><br /> Modernly, however, at common law, the solicitation must have been for the commission of a felony. If the act solicitated is committed the solicitation is merged into the crime. Here Bob and Anna agreed to solicit Cindy to commit an arson, a crime. When Bob and Anna contracted with Cindy to burn the warehouse they committed an overt act and can be charged with conspiracy to solicit Cindy to commit arson. Since the arson was committed, infra, the solicitation will merge into the arson.<br /><br /> <b>ARSON</b><br /><br /> Defined Supra.<br /><br /> <b>Accomplice Liability</b><br /><br /> An accomplice in the first degree is one who is present at the time of the commission of the crime who may not actually be the principal. An accomplice in the second degree is not present at the time of the crime, but who has the intent to commit the crime and who aids or abets the others in the commission of the crime. Here, Anna was neither present, [n]or apparently aided nor abetted in the arson and therefore would not be liable as [an] accomplice. However, as a member of a conspiracy, supra, all parties are liable for the foreseeable criminal acts of the other parties. Here Anna conspired to burn the structure. If Cindy committed Arson, Anna would be held liable.<br /><br /> Based on conspiracy liability, at common law Anna would not be guilty of Arson because the building was not a dwelling. However, modernly the dwelling has been expanded and would include the warehouse. Because Cindy intentionally (maliciously) burned the warehouse, Anna would be charged with Arson.<br /><br /> <b>MURDER.</b><br /><br /> Murder is the unlawful killing of another human being with malice aforethought. Malice aforethought is the intentional killing or implied killing through infliction of great bodily harm, unreasonable risk to human life (depraved heart), commission of felony or in some jurisdictions resisting lawful arrest. There must be a causation between the act and the killing.<br /><br /> All murder is second degree unless it is premeditated, killing by enumerated means, or during the commission of a dangerous felony. Then it is statutory first degree murder. Arson, supra, is a dangerous felony.<br /><br /> Here a killing of another occurred because Daryll died. The killing was the actual cause because but for the arson, Daryll would not have died. The arson is the proximate cause of the killing because there were not unforeseen intervening factors that negated the arson as the cause in fact of Daryll's death. Therefore the killing was caused by the arson.<br /><br /> Felony first degree murder is applicable because arson is a dangerous felony. Daryll's death is a result of and occurred during the arson. Further, since a conspirator is responsible for the crimes committed by the other parties to the conspiracy, that are foreseeable, which a death is foreseeable during an arson, Anna would be responsible for Daryll's death and charged with Statutory first degree murder.<br /><br /> Alternative second degree murder. In the event the jury does not believe that it was foreseeable Daryll would be in there because the building was a warehouse and people do not live in warehouses, the jury could find Anna responsible for second degree murder under the theory of unjustifiable risk to human life since the burning of any structure is an uncontrollable event and the likelihood is the fire can get out of control, the agreement to burn the warehouse places human life in unjustifiable risk.<br /><br /> <b>DEFENSE TO MURDER:</b> <br /><br /><b>A mistake of fact</b>, i.e., the warehouse is empty, does not apply because a mistake of a fact is not a defense to a general intent crime, which second degree murder and arson are both (sic).<br /><br /> There are not other defenses to the crime that are applicable. <b>ATTEMPT FRAUD:</b> An attempt is a significant step towards the commission of a crime coupled with the intent to commit the crime. An attempt can be for any form, but the defendant must have the specific intent of desiring the commission of a[n] actual crime. Fraud, supra, is a crime. Anna intended to partake in the fraud with Bob of his insurance company. Here [sic] and Bob took a significant step towards the crime then they hired Cindy to burn down the building. Anna will argue that the significant step to the fraud is the filing of the insurance claims and because they did not they did not take a significant step and therefore are not guilty of attempt[ed] fraud. The prosecution will argue that one [sic] the burning occurred, the attempt was in place, and it was too late to back out since a withdrawal of an attempt is generally not a defense as the crime is the \"attempt\" and the specific means to commit that crime. If not for the burning of the warehouse, Anna could argue the significant step did not occur. However, Anna will be charged with attempt to commit fraud.<br /><br /> <b>PEOPLE V. BOB:</b> Bob will be charged for the same reasons as set forth above for Anna with crimes of conspiracy to commit arson, conspiracy to commit fraud, murder and attempted fraud. In addition Bob will be charged with solicitation, supra, of arson, and fraud.<br /><br /> Solicitation to commit arson, for the same reasons set forth in Anna. (In addition Bob solicited Anna to commit arson.) Bob will not be charged with solicitation to commit arson as the arson occurred and the solicitation is merged into that crime.<br /><br /> However, Bob did encourage Anna to commit fraud by suggesting they hire someone to burn down the warehouse and collect the insurance proceeds, since the fraud was not committed, Bob will be charged with solicitation of Anna to commit fraud.<br /><br /> <b>PEOPLE V. CINDY:</b> As set forth above Cindy will be charged with conspiracy to commit arson, arson and murder."

				"<b>STATE V. DAN (D)</b><br /><br /> <b>AGGRAVATED ASSAULT</b><br /><br /> Assault is either a substantial step toward an intended battery or the intentional placing of another in reasonable apprehension of imminent bodily harm. Modernly, an aggravated assault is an assault committed with a deadly weapon.<br /><br /> Here, the facts indicate that D shot at Vic (V), intending to wound him. If V was apprehensive of being shot, D will be guilty of assault. Additionally, because D shot at V with a deadly weapon, a gun, D will modernly be guilty of aggravated assault.<br /><br /> D will be guilty of aggravated assault. However, the assault will merge with the subsequent homicide.<br /><br /> <b>AGGRAVATED BATTERY</b><br /><br /> Battery is the unlawful application of force to the person of another. Modernly, a battery is aggravated if it is committed with a deadly weapon.<br /><br /> Here, D intended to wound V by shooting V in the leg. However, the bullet actually killed V by striking him elsewhere. Under the doctrine of transferred intent, D will be guilty of the battery because the intended harm was criminal, and there is great similarity between the intended harm and the harm that actually occurred. Furthermore, because D used a gun to batter V, D will be guilty of aggravated battery.<br /><br /> D will be guilty of aggravated battery, though it will merge with the subsequent homicide.<br /><br /> <b>HOMICIDE OF V</b><br /><br /> HOMICIDE is the killing of a human being by another human being. Here, the facts indicate that D killed V by shooting at V with a gun. There is a homicide.<br /><br /> <b>CAUSATION - ACTUAL CAUSE</b><br /><br /> But for D shooting at V, V would not have died.<br /><br /> <b>CAUSATION - PROXIMATE CAUSE</b><br /><br /> It is foreseeable that shooting to someone with intent to injure could result in a death.<br /><br /> <b>MURDER</b><br /><br /> Murder is an unlawful homicide committed with malice aforethought. Malice aforethought may be proven under any of four theories.<br /><br /> <b>1) INTENT TO KILL</b> - Intent requires the conscious desire to cause the criminal result. The facts indicate that D only intended to wound V, not kill V. Thus, D did not have the specific intent to kill.<br /><br /> <b>2) INTENT TO INFLICT SERIOUS BODILY HARM</b> - Here, the facts indicate that D shot at V with the intent to hitting [sic] V in the leg. Shooting someone in the leg is likely to cause serious bodily harm and the facts indicate that D intended to wound V. Under this theory, then, D intended to cause serious bodily harm.<br /><br /> <b>3) DEPRAVED HEART ACT</b> - A depraved heart act is a wanton and reckless disregard for the value of human life. Here, D shot at V in a public place with an intent to wound V in the leg. Shooting someone in the leg present[s] numerous, dangerous risk[s] to his welfare and court[s] normally hold that any act that [is] likely to cause serious harm to others is a depraved heart act if the risk is disregarded.<br /><br /> <b>4) APPLICATION OF THE FELONY MURDER RULE</b> - A killing will be felony if it 1) occurs during the res gestae of a dangerous felony or a felony committed in a dangerous way, 2) is foreseeable, and 3) is independent of the target crime. Here, the State will not bring a charge of felony murder, because the only predicate felonies would merge with the crime. Because of public policy reasons, courts refuse to apply felony murder to felonious assaults and batteries, otherwise, strict liability for first degree murder would result from each killing.<br /><br /> Having found malice under the theories of 2) intent to inflict serious bodily harm, and 3) depraved heart act, the State will proceed as follows.<br /><br /> <b>FIRST DEGREE MURDER</b><br /><br /> First degree murder is an unlawful homicide committed with premeditation and deliberation and specific intent to kill. Premeditation and deliberation may be proven by application of the felony murder rule, or a killing by poison, bomb, torture, or ambush.<br /><br /> Here, the facts indicate that D lacked the specific intent to kill and the felony murder rule will not apply. The State will not bring a charge of first degree murder.<br /><br /> <b>SECOND DEGREE MURDER</b><br /><br /> All murder not raised to the first degree shall be second degree murder. Here, because the State proved malice under two theories, but did not raise the charge to first degree murder, the State will bring a charge of second degree murder. Because the State established malice under 2) intent to inflict serious bodily harm, and 3) depraved heart act, D will be guilty of second degree murder absent a defense.<br /><br /> D will be guilty of second degree murder.<br /><br /> <b>VOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER</b><br /><br /> Voluntary manslaughter is an intentional homicide committed with malice, but with mitigation. Mitigation may be proven by adequate provocation or mistaken justification.<br /><br /> Here, D may try to claim that he was provoked into shooting V. However, the first element of adequate provocation requires that a reasonable person be provoked by the conduct. Here, a reasonable person would not have been provoked by V's approach, so V may not claim provocation. Additionally, D may claim that his defense of self-defense is imperfect and results in a charge of voluntary manslaughter. As discussed infra, D will raise a defense of self-defense, and this defense will be imperfect. A court may apply this rule of mitigation to lessen the offense to voluntary manslaughter.<br /><br /> The State may bring a charge of voluntary manslaughter. D will be guilty of voluntary manslaughter if he succeeds in mitigating his crime by an imperfect selfdefense claim.<br /><br /> <b>INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER</b><br /><br /> Involuntary manslaughter is an unintentional homicide that results from 1) application of the misdemeanor manslaughter rule, 2) intent to inflict non-serious bodily harm, 3) criminal negligence.<br /><br /> Here, D will try to mitigate his charge by claiming that the homicide was only involuntary manslaughter. D will claim that he only intended non-serious bodily harm and the killing was accidental. However, court[s] consistently hold that any intent to harm with a deadly weapon infers an intent to inflict serious bodily harm. Additionally, D may claim that he was only criminally negligent, not reckless. D's claim may work depending on the surrounding situation of the terrain.<br /><br /> The State may charge D with the lesser included offense of involuntary manslaughter.<br /><br /> <b>DEFENSES TO HOMICIDE</b><br /><br /> <b>SELF-DEFENSE</b><br /><br /> Self-defense [is] the actual and reasonable apprehensions of bodily harm. Here, D may claim that he believed V would harm him. However, this belief is not reasonable, because a reasonable person would not have assumed V's approach meant V intended to do harm. Furthermore, D used unreasonable force because V was not threatening any harm.<br /><br /> D's claim of self-defense will fail, but may constitute an imperfect self-defense that mitigates the homicide, as discussed supra.<br /><br /> <b>INSANITY - M'NAUGHTEN RULE</b><br /><br /> The defendant is entitled to acquittal, if at the time of the crimes and as a result of a mental condition, he 1) did not know the nature or quality of his act, 2) or that his act was wrong.<br /><br /> Under this rule, D may claim that he believed V was going to attack D and kill D. If D subjectively held this belief, then he would have been permitted to defend himself. Even though this believe was unreasonable, in jurisdictions applying the M'Naughten rule, D may not have believed his act was wrong.<br /><br /> D may be able to escape guilt under the M'Naughten rule.<br /><br /> <b>INSANITY - MODEL PENAL CODE</b><br /><br /> Defendant is entitled to acquittal if at the time of the crime and as a result of a mental condition, he 1) lacked the capacity to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law, or 2) did not know his act was wrong.<br /><br /> Even though D was capable of conforming to the requirements of the law, he may claim that he did not know his act was wrong, because he believed he needed to defend himself. In jurisdictions holding to the MPC insanity position, D would need to prove he did not know his act was wrong.<br /><br /> D may avoid guilt under the MPC test for insanity.<br /><br /> <b>IRRESISTIBLE IMPULSE TEST</b><br /><br /> Defendant is entitled to acquittal if his crime was the result of an irresistible impulse that overcame his will.<br /><br /> Under this test, D would need to prove he was unable to control himself when he shot V. This test would probably not provide a defense because D could have controlled himself, he just thought he needed to defend himself.<br /><br /> D will probably be guilty in jurisdictions applying the irresistible impulse test.<br /><br /> <b>DURHAM RULE</b><br /><br /> Defendant is entitled to acquittal if his crime was the product of a mental defect.<br /><br /> Here, D's crime appears to be the product of a mental defect. That is, D believed V would kill D because of a delusion.<br /><br /> In the minority of jurisdictions that apply the Durham Rule, D may avoid guilt because the crime was the product of mental defect.<br /><br /> <b>WELLS-GORSHEN RULE</b><br /><br /> Under the Wells-Gorshen rule, insanity defenses that do not give rise to absolute defenses may negate the mens rea requirement of a crime.<br /><br /> Here, D may claim that he lacked the mens rea to commit murder because he thought V was going to do harm to D. However, under the malice theories, the State proved that D intended to harm V. Even though D thought he was acting in self-defense, he still intended this harm.<br /><br /> The Wells-Gorshen rule will not apply here.<br /><br /> <b>DIMINISHED CAPACITY</b><br /><br /> Here, D may try to argue that his delusions diminished his capacity to form the intent to commit murder. This rule only applies in a small minority of jurisdictions and usually is applicable only to negate the mens rea of a crime. Here, D is not seeking to negate the mens rea.<br /><br /> Diminished capacity will not apply.",
				"<b>CHARLES V. DAN</b><br /><br /> <b>HOMICIDE CHARGES.</b><br /><br /> <b>Murder:</b> Murder is the voluntary taking of the life of another with malice. Malice can be shown by perpetrator's intent to kill, by his being responsible for death during commission of a dangerous felony (\"felony murder\"), by acting in a manner demonstrating a wanton disregard for human life, or by intending to inflict serious injury.<br /><br /> Here, Dan is on a busy street and is approached by someone he imagines intends to hurt him. Dan is carrying a concealed weapon, a gun, with which he shoots in Vic's direction intending, he says, \"only to wound him,\" but a ricochet bullet kills Vic.<br /><br /> -There is clearly a homicide and Dan is clearly the cause. But for Dan's firing, voluntarily, the gun, Vic would not be dead.<br /><br /> -Intent: First degree murder is a specific intent crime, usually shown by evidence of premeditation and deliberation, or by felony murder. Felony murder is not likely to apply here. Though crimes of carrying [a] concealed weapon and criminal assault might be felonies, the shooting did not occur in furtherance of these crimes. So, premeditation and deliberation are the focus [sic]. A case can be made that Dan premeditated this crime by the fact that he was carrying a concealed gun. Moreover, deliberation can occur in a very short time; even a moment's deliberation can be enough to sustain the charges. Here Dan thought about his act long enough to consider Vic's \"scruffy\" appearance to be a threat to him, and to decide to shoot.<br /><br /> <b>Second Degree Murder</b><br /><br /> Intent to inflict serious bodily harm satisfies the malice requirement. Vic shot \"to wound Vic in the legs.\" A bullet to the legs is surely serious bodily harm, so Vic can be found to have malice on this basis.<br /><br /> Likewise, Vic's shooting a gun on a \"busy street\" is likely \"wanton disregard for human life\" so that Vic's malice can be shown to be based upon \"depraved heart.\" Finally, the killing of a person by \"dangerous means\" as a lethal weapon, here, a gun, is sufficient to establish intent.<br /><br /> <b>Conclusion</b><br /><br /> Prosecutor can charge Dan with first degree murder based upon his intent, shown by carrying and firing [a] gun on [a] busy street and his premeditation. Second degree murder included.<br /><br /> <b>Assault and Battery</b><br /><br /> Criminal assault merges into battery where the threat which constitutes assault occurs simultaneously with the harmful touching required for battery.<br /><br /> Criminal battery is the harmful or offensive touching of another without consent. The touching may be indirect so long as a physical touching occurs and the object which touches was set in motion by the perpetrator. Here Dan clearly caused the bullet to \"touch\" Vic in harmful manner.<br /><br /> <b>Conclusion</b><br /><br /> Vic can be charged with criminal assault and battery.<br /><br /> N.B. Legal statutes may result in a gun charge v. Dan.<br /><br /> <b>Defenses For Dan</b><br /><br /> <b>Justification</b><br /><br /> A justification excuses the crime and results in \"no crime.\" Here, Dan will argue selfdefense as justification. Self-defense excuses a killing if the perpetrator acted reasonably (general intent) and in good faith (specific and general intent crimes) to protect self from serious bodily injury or death and if the actions in defense were proportionate to the threat.<br /><br /> Here, Dan will argue he only acted to save himself from Vic, whom he believed intended to kill him, and that deadly force was proportionate and justified. However, since Vic made no threatening gestures toward Dan and there are facts suggesting Vic was brandishing a weapon, a reasonable person in Dan's position would not have concluded his life was in jeopardy. So Dan's excuse falls in the majority. His \"good faith\" alone is irrelevant to second degree murder, a general intent crime. In a minority of jurisdictions, if his mistake is found to be in \"honest\" or in \"good faith,\" the crime may be mitigated to voluntary manslaughter.<br /><br /> <b>Conclusion</b><br /><br /> Self-defense is not likely available to Dan.<br /><br /> <b>Excuses:</b><br /><br /> Dan will defend saying he did not have the requisite intent for murder. He will say he only intended to wound Vic. However, as discussed above, both the specific intent for first degree murder and general intent for second degree are supported by his acts. His intent to do serious bodily harm by wounding Vic with a bullet, the use of a gun, [and] the thinking he did before firing all support Vic's having requisite intent for murder, arguably first degree.<br /><br /> <b>Insanity</b><br /><br /> In majority the defense of insanity is established if, at the time of the offense, the perpetrator was suffering from a serious mental defect or disease such that he lacked substantial capacity either to appreciate the wrongfulness of his act or to conform his behavior to the requirements of the law (A.L.I).<br /><br /> Here, while Dan is described as having a \"pathological fear\" of long -haired persons, we do not know if he has had an established diagnosis of serious mental illness. If he does have such a defect or disease, Dan will have to show that his delusional state was of the kind that anyone believing as he did would have acted in the manner he did or that his disease caused him to lack substantial capacity to understand that he was shooting someone or that it is a crime to do so.<br /><br /> <b>Involuntary Manslaughter</b><br /><br /> Involuntary manslaughter is the killing of another in a state of passion or high emotional arousal caused by a provocation, more than mere words, that would have aroused such emotion in any reasonable person in that position, and that there was no time for the person to \"cool off\", and that he did not, in fact, cool off. Here Dan will argue that Vic's coming toward him looking as he did caused Dan to be so afraid that he acted in a state of high emotion.<br /><br /> <b>Conclusion</b><br /><br /> Dan's arousal is not that which a reasonable person in his situation would experience. Dan's mental illness is not considered in this formulation.<br /><br /> <b>Conclusion</b><br /><br /> Charges of murder in first degree will lie against Dan, though they may be dropped to second degree murder. Dan's defenses will fail, except possibly the insanity defense, for which we have insufficient information to decide."

			"essay": "Bill and his wife, Alice, fought constantly. On occasion Alice had to miss work when Bill physically beat her up during quarrels. Alice is Chuck's supervisor at Acme Bank. Chuck would like to take over Alice's job at the bank. Knowing of Bill's violent temper, Chuck devised a scheme that he hoped would induce Bill to murder Alice, so that Chuck would be promoted to Alice's position at the bank.<br /><br /> One evening, Chuck followed Bill to his favorite bar. When Bill had become very drunk, Chuck told him that Alice was having an affair with the bank president and that Chuck had found them locked in an embrace in the president's office that very afternoon. Chuck's story was completely fabricated. As Chuck expected, Bill became furious and ran out of the bar in a rage, shouting, \"This time I'm going to kill her.\"<br /><br /> On the way home, Bill, who was still obviously drunk and in a state of severe agitation, stopped at a sporting goods store and bought a shotgun. The store owner, Dave, sold him the gun, even though Bill stated to Dave that he was going to use it to kill his wife. Bill rushed to his house with the gun, looked through a window, and saw Alice sitting at the dining room table playing cards with a neighbor, Emily. He stood outside the window and took aim at Alice. Meanwhile, Emily's husband Fred was coming to pick up his wife. Fred saw Bill and tackled him, hoping to disarm Bill before he fired the gun. Unfortunately, Bill pulled the trigger just as he was tackled by Fred, and the deflected shot hit and killed Emily.<br /><br /> With what crime or crimes, if any, should Chuck, Bill, Dave and Fred be charged and what, if any, defenses should each assert? Discuss.",
			"sampleAnswers": [
				"<b>I. Crimes of Chuck</b><br /><br /> <b>Solicitation?</b> Solicitation occurs if one person asks another to commit a crime with the intent that the crime be committed. Here, Chuck did not ask Bill to kill Alice, but merely set it up so he would be likely to. Thus, although there was intent that the crime be committed, Chuck did not ask. He just told a lie to Bill. Thus, no solicitation.<br /><br /> <b>Accomplice?</b> One is liable as the accomplice to the crime of another if he encourages or assists in committing it with the intent to promote or facilitate commission of the crime. Here, Chuck intended that Bill kill Alice because he wanted Alice's job at the bank. He assisted in the commission of the crime because it was his lie that enraged Bill to begin with, and he obviously intended Bill to do just what he did. Thus, Chuck can be convicted of all the crimes of Bill as an accomplice that were committed after he told the lie to Bill.<br /><br /> <b>II. Crimes of Bill</b><br /><br /> <b>1. Battery?</b> Criminal battery is the unlawful application of force to the person of another that results in physical harm or an offensive touching. Here, Bill unlawfully applied force to Alice because he \"physically beat\" her during quarrels. Such beatings would certainly consist of offensive touching, but probably physical harm as well. Thus, Bill can be charged with battery.<br /><br /> <b>2. Assault?</b> Criminal assault comes in at least two varieties: an attempted battery or intentionally placing another in apprehension of an imminent battery. Here, the facts show only that Bill and Alice fought constantly and that Bill beat her during quarrels. Although it could reasonable[sic] be implied that Alice experienced apprehension of an imminent battery or that Bill occasionally missed in an attempted battery, assault would merge with battery anyway. Thus, assault will merge with battery.<br /><br /> <b>3. Murder of Emily?</b> Murder is the unlawful killing of another human being with malice. Malice can be established in any one of four circumstances: intent to kill, intent to cause serious bodily harm, willful and wanton conduct (depraved heart), and the felony murder rule. Here, the[sic] Bill intended to kill Alice because he \"took aim at Alice\" while he was standing outside pointing a shotgun at her.<br /><br /> Under the doctrine of transferred intent, the intent to kill one person can be transferred to another person if the other person is the one who winds up getting killed. Here, Fred tried to stop Bill from shooting into the window but was too late to keep Bill from firing the gun. Unfortunately, he wound up shooting and killing Emily, his wife.<br /><br /> Furthermore, under the deadly weapon doctrine intent to kill can be inferred from the use of a deadly weapon, such as the loaded shotgun in this case. Here, the intent to kill can be inferred because Bill used a shotgun to kill Emily. However, that intent can be rebutted as discussed below.<br /><br /> However, further analysis is necessary because murder can be mitigated to voluntary manslaughter under adequate provocation (heat of passion). Such mitigation requires that the defendant be sufficiently provoked to become enraged, that a reasonable person would also have become enraged, the person did not cool off, and a reasonable person would not have cooled off. Sufficient legal provocation includes finding your spouse engaged in intimate relations with another person. Here, although there might initially be sufficient provocation when Chuck told the made-up story about Alice and the bank president having an affair (he yelled \"This time I'm going to kill her!\" and he was in a rage), when Bill got to his house all he saw was Alice and Emily playing cards at the table. A reasonable person may have not become so enraged as this just from hearing about it. However, if a reasonable person would have been enraged and wouldn't have cooled off, the murder of Emily might be mitigated to voluntary manslaughter. Here, a reasonable person would not have become so enraged.<br /><br /> If not, and the intoxication (discussed below) negates intent to kill, there are sufficient facts to show willful and wanton conduct because shooting a shotgun at another person clearly shows such disregard for the value of human life and a very high degree of risk of at the least seriously bodily harm. Voluntary intoxication cannot negate a general intent crime such as depraved heart murder.<br /><br /> Thus, Bill can be charged with the murder of Emily.<br /><br /> <b>4. Attempted murder of Alice?</b> Attempt is the specific intent to commit a crime and legally sufficient substantial step in furtherance of that intent that goes beyond mere preparation. Here, Bill appears to have the requisite intent to kill because he shouted that he was going to kill Alice. The act required must be a substantial step, which is either close proximity to committing the crime, an unequivocal act that suggests the criminal intent, or is strongly corroborative of the criminal purpose. Here, Bill took the requisite substantial step because under any test his act of pointing the gun at Alice and killing her was only stopped by Fred tackling him. Thus, Bill would be charged with the attempted murder of Alice, unless there is a defense.<br /><br /> Bill's intoxication? Bill may argue that he did not have the requisite intent because he had become \"very drunk\". Intoxication can be defense to criminal conduct if it negates a required mental state. If Bill was so drunk that he could not form the requisite intent, then he cannot be charged with intent. Such intoxication must be so severe that it is no different than insanity, which, under the majority rule would require that Bill be unable to distinguish the nature or quality of his acts, or if he could, he did not know they were wrong. Here, that defense will probably fail because of the history Bill had with Alice and how readily he got mad.<br /><br /> Thus, Bill's intoxication will be no defense to attempted murder. <br /><br /> <b>III. Crimes of Dave</b><br /><br /> <b>1. Accomplice liability?</b> Accomplice defined above. Here, Dave may have the requisite intent that the crime be committed (murder of Alice) because Bill told Dave that he was going to use the shotgun to kill Alice and Dave sold the shotgun to him anyway. Under this circumstance, Dave will have assisted in the killing of Alice sufficient for him also to be convicted of murder.<br /><br /> <b>IV. Crimes of Fred</b><br /><br /> <b>Battery of Bill?</b> Battery defined above. Although Fred's tackling of Bill resulted in the death of his wife Emily, Fred was attempting to prevent Bill from shooting. Defense of others is a valid defense if one reasonably believes that another person is in imminent danger of an unlawful attack and uses reasonable force to prevent it. Here, Fred had a reasonable belief someone was under an unlawful attack because he saw Bill pointing the shotgun at someone through the window. Tackling Bill would be reasonable force because he saw that Bill was about to shoot. Thus, Fred will not be charged with the battery of Bill. There are no facts to suggest that Fred has committed any other crimes.",
				"<b>State v. Chuck</b><br /><br /> <b>(1) Solicitation</b><br /><br /> Solicitation occurs when the defendant (1) encourages, invites, or in some way requests another to commit a crime, (2) with the specific intent for that person to commit that crime. Here, Chuck followed Bill to a bar and told him that his wife Alice was \"having an affair with the bank president...\" Since Chuck \"hoped [he could] induce Bill to murder Alice\", he was requesting that Bill commit a crime. Since Chuck wanted Bill to murder Alice, he intended that the crime be committed. Chuck can be charged with solicitation. It s[h]hould be noted that, if according to the doctrine of accomplice liability, discussed next, Dave is charged with a substantive crime, the solicitation will merge with that crime.<br /><br /> <b>(2) Accomplice liability for murder of Emily, attempted murder of Alice</b><br /><br /> An accomplice is one who assist[sic] another in the commission of a crime. In that sense, any actions which are foreseeable consequences of that crime will cause liability to attach to the accomplice. Here, Dave intended that Bill murder Alice; so, when Bill attempted to murder her (discussed infra), Dave became liable. Similarly, because it was foreseeable that Bill might murder the wrong person, attachment for murder would also occur. For whatever Bill can be charged with in connection with his attempt to murder Alice, so can Dave.<br /><br /> <b>State v. Bill</b><br /><br /> <b>(1) Murder of Emily</b><br /><br /> Murder is the (1) unlawful (2) killing of a (3) human being by (4) another human being with (5) malice aforethought. Here, Emily was killed when Bill shot her by mistake. Because there was no legal basis for this shooting, it was unlawful. Because Emily was a person who died, there was a killing of a human being. Because Bill did the killing, it was performed by another human being. Was there malice aforethought? The word aforethought just means that the mens rea (culpable mental state) was formed prior to the murder, which it was because Bill \"took aim\" before he killed.<br /><br /> <b>Malice?</b><br /><br /> Malice occurs in four varieties: (1) intent to kill, (2) intent to inflict serious injury, (3) reckless disregard for the value of human life (depraved heart), and (4) the felony murder rule. <br /><br /> <b>Intent to kill or seriously injure?</b><br /><br /> Intent to kill can be inferred through the lethal weapon doctrine, in which the defendant uses a deadly weapon such as a gun in a manner it was intended. Here, Bill bought a shotgun just prior to using it, further indicating intent to kill. Finally, at the bar, he affirmed his intent to kill when he shouted, \"This time I'm going to kill her.\"<br /><br /> <b>Reckless disregard for human life (depraved heart)?</b><br /><br /> This version of malice is present whenever the defendant knows of a substantial risk of lethal danger to others and willfully disregards that risk and proceeds with his risky behavior nevertheless. Here, by pointing a loaded shotgun at a house with people inside, Bill demonstrated such a depraved heart.<br /><br /> Bill has acted with malice and can be charged with murder.<br /><br /> <b>Defenses?</b><br /><br /> Bill may claim adequate provocation and heat of passion, which would be a mitigation defense leading to voluntary manslaughter.<br /><br /> <b>Voluntary manslaughter?</b><br /><br /> Voluntary manslaughter occurs when the defendant (1) intentionally kills another under the (2) heat of passion arising out of (3) an adequate provocation, from which (4) neither he nor the reasonable person would have been able to withstand or (5) cool off from within the time period of his actions. In fact, the law does recognize the sudden knowledge that one's spouse is having an affair as adequate provocation. In addition, here, Bill took immediate action on that knowledge and killed as soon as he could buy a gun and get back to his house. Whether during this period a reasonable person would have cooled off is a jury call.<br /><br /> <b>Voluntary intoxification?</b><br /><br /> Bill may argue that he wasn't in full control of his reasoning because he was drunk, and that he killed because of that fact, among others.<br /><br /> However, the law doesn't recognize this defense. Voluntary intoxification is mainly a defense to a specific intent where it negates the element of premeditation and deliberation; however, for common law murder, which is a malice crime, voluntary intoxification is not a defense.<br /><br /> <b>(2) 1st degree murder of Emily</b><br /><br /> 1st degree murder is that murder which is committed with premeditation and deliberation. Premeditation requires that the defendant ponder his actions ahead of time, and deliberation requires that he analyze his actions to be sure he wants to proceed. Here, Bill bought a shotgun, which he immediately used to kill Emily with[sic]. This indicates purpose of action (he was thinking specifically about what he was going to do). He also aimed the gun at a person, which further indicates purpose and thought. Arguably, Bill has acted with premeditation and deliberation.<br /><br /> <b>Defenses?</b><br /><br /> <b>Voluntary intoxification?</b><br /><br /> This has been discussed supra. Voluntary intoxification may be a viable defense here because it can negate the specific intent required for this crime. Arguably, Bill's defense may prevail.<br /><br /> <b>Mistake of fact?</b><br /><br /> Bill may also argue that his specific intent was not to kill Emily, but rather Alice; however, the doctrine of transferred intent (where the result was not what was intended, but is applicable anyway) will apply here because the elements of Bill's crime are all present, and the law doesn't require that the person be the person intended to be killed.<br /><br /> <b>(3) Attempted murder of Alice</b><br /><br /> An attempt crime occurs (1) when the defendant is unsuccessful in the commission of his specifically intended crime, but (2) where he has taken enough steps toward that conclusion to quality[sic] as proximate.<br /><br /> <b>Specific intent?</b><br /><br /> Bill bought the shotgun \"to use it to kill his wife\"; therefore, he had the specific intent to kill, which is the required intent for attempted murder.<br /><br /> <b>Proximity?</b><br /><br /> The last act test can be used to determine proximity if the defendant has accomplished all but the last act needed to complete his crime. Here, but for Fred's intervention, Bill would surely have murdered Alice; therefore, he has satisfied the proximity element.<br /><br /> <b>State v. Dave</b><br /><br /> <b>(1) Accomplice liability for murder, attempted murder</b><br /><br /> Dave may be liable for this if he in some manner assisted in Bill's crime by selling him the shotgun. However, even where a defendant knows that criminal activity may occur, there is no liability where that defendant has no stake in the criminal activities. Since there's no indication that Dave charged Bill any more than the usual price for the gun, he probably didn't have a stake in Bill's actions. Since Dave's knowledge was not bolstered by any other staking-creating behavior on his part, he will probably not be held liable for Bill's actions.<br /><br /> <b>State v. Fred</b><br /><br /> <b>(1) Battery</b><br /><br /> Battery is the voluntary and intentional touching of another person in either a harmful or offensive manner. Here, Fred tackled Bill as he (Bill) was taking aim to fire his gun; therefore, the touching was probably offensive at the least, and even harmful if Bill was injured. However, Fred has a defense.<br /><br /> <b>Defense of Others</b><br /><br /> Where one fears an unlawful, imminent and harmful battery on another, that person is privileged to use whatever reasonable force is necessary to protect the interests of the other person. Since Fred saw Bill pointing his gun at a window, he probably knew that Bill was preparing to shoot, and he acted in such defense of others. Fred's defense will prevail."

Expecting that Bill would follow the same route and schedule that had been in effect before Tom was fired, Tom hid behind a newsstand near a bank where the armored car ordinarily picked up the bank’s daily receipts.

Tom bought a book that contained instructions for making a bomb that would be powerful enough to completely destroy an armored car, purchased the necessary explosives and detonation materials, and began to assemble the bomb in the garage attached to the house where he rented a room from the owner, who also resided there. While he was assembling the bomb, Tom inadvertently ignited the materials, causing an explosion and fire that resulted in burning down the house and garage.<br /><br /> What crimes, if any, did Tom commit? Explain fully.",

			"essay": "Dan separated from his wife, Bess, and moved out of the house they own together. About one week later, on his way to work the night shift, Dan passed by the house and saw a light on. He stopped and rang the bell. Bess answered the door. She was polite, but told him she was getting ready to go out with her girlfriends. As Dan left, he saw a pair of men’s shoes in the entryway.<br /><br /> Later that night, Dan told his friend, Fred, about the shoes. Fred said: “Let’s go over there and check it out. We’ll use my car so Bess won’t recognize it.” Dan and Fred drove over to the house, and parked a block away, so the car would not be seen by Bess. Fred waited in the car while Dan went around the side of the house, turned over a garbage can and climbed on top to look through the open bedroom window. Dan saw a man, Chris, on the bed with Bess. Dan jumped through the open window and started yelling at Bess, “How could you do this?”<br /><br /> Dan then went to the closet and grabbed his shotgun, which was locked in a plastic case. He turned to Chris, and chased him down the stairs and out of the house, yelling deadly threats. Chris tripped, fell, and hit his head on the front steps. The fall knocked him unconscious.<br /><br /> Bess called the police. When the police arrived, Dan was sitting outside on the front porch holding the shotgun, still in the locked case. Dan told the police that he had chased Chris out because he feared his wife had been in danger.<br /><br /> Fred got out of the car and came over to the scene. The police placed Dan in custody and asked Fred to meet them at the station for further questioning.<br /><br /> 1. With what crime or crimes, if any, can Dan reasonably be charged and what defenses, if any, can he reasonably assert? Discuss.<br /><br /> 2. With what crime or crimes, if any, can Fred reasonably be charged and what defenses, if any, can he reasonably assert? Discuss.",

			"essay": "Pete is a salesperson at XYZ Real Estate Company (“XYZ”). Vic owned a parcel of industrial real estate that he wanted to sell. Vic retained Pete as his agent to sell the parcel for him, and they agreed to list the parcel for a price of $100,000. Developer contacted Pete and expressed interest in buying Vic’s property.<br /><br /> Pete falsely told Vic that a soils test report revealed serious toxic contamination on the parcel and that, because of high cleanup costs, the most Vic could hope to get for the parcel was $15,000 to $17,000. Vic said, “OK. Do your best.”<br /><br /> About a week later, Pete persuaded his friend, Frank, to sign an offer to Vic, offering to pay $17,000 for the parcel. When Frank asked why Pete wanted him to do this, Pete told him, “The actual buyer is traveling in Europe and can’t get back in time to sign the papers, so he authorized me to find someone to sign for him. I’m designating you as that person, but, don’t worry, you won’t be liable for anything.” Believing Pete’s explanation, Frank agreed to sign out of his friendship with Pete. Pete presented the offer signed by Frank, and Vic accepted it.<br /><br /> Pete, figuring he would temporarily “borrow” $17,000 from XYZ, wrote a check on the XYZ bank account for $17,000 and gave it to Frank to deposit into Frank’s account. Frank attended the real estate closing, obtained the deed, and gave Vic his personal check for $17,000. Two days later, Pete sold the property to Developer for $100,000. From the proceeds of that sale, Pete returned the $17,000 to XYZ’s account and kept the balance for himself.<br /><br /> 1. Of what crimes, if any, can Pete be convicted? Discuss.<br /><br /> 2. With what crime might Frank be charged, and is it likely he would be convicted? Discuss.<br /><br /> 3. Is Pete guilty of solicitation?",
