			"essay": "Debbie and Jon met in college and dated each other for two years. Debbie loved Jon very much and wanted to marry him. Jon always told her that he loved only her, but he told her he thought they were too young and should not rush into marriage.<br /><br /> One day as Debbie was putting gasoline into her car at the gasoline station, she looked into the car parked next to hers. She was enraged to see her best friend Vickie passionately kissing Jon. Debbie walked over to the car, with the fuel dispenser in her hand, and started yelling at Vickie and Jon. Vickie said, \"I'm sorry you had to find out this way. Jon and I love each other and are going to get married.\"<br /><br /> Debbie was enraged and shouted, \"You're not going to marry anyone, you slime!\" She then pointed the gasoline dispenser at Vickie and sprayed her with gasoline, soaking her hair and clothes. Jon reached over to try to help Vickie. Unfortunately, he was smoking a cigarette. The cigarette ignited the gasoline and Vickie burned to death.<br /><br /> What offense or offenses has Debbie committed and what defenses, if any, would she assert? Discuss.",
			"sampleAnswers": [
				"<b>1) Assault</b> <br /><br />An assault is an act which causes an immediate apprehension of a harmful or offensive contact.<br /><br /> In this case, the state may argue that when Debbie pointed the gasoline dispenser at Vickie, while shouting at her, Vickie could have reasonably apprehended an unlawful and offensive contact, i.e., being sprayed with gasoline. <br /><br />Debbie has committed an assault.<br /><br /><b>2) Battery </b><br /><br />Battery is an act which causes a person to suffer a harmful or offensive contact.<br /><br /> The state may argue that spraying Vickie with gasoline, soaking her hair and clothes, constituted a harmful and offensive contact.<br /><br /> Debbie has committed a battery, but it will merge with the crimes discussed below.<br /><br /><b>3) Homicide</b><br /><br /> Homicide is the death of a human being, which is caused by another human being.<br /><br /> In this case, Vickie was burned to death, so there is a death of a human being.<br /><br /> <b>4) Actual Cause</b><br /><br /> But for Debbie's act of spraying Vickie with gasoline, she would not have been burned to death, so Debbie is the actual cause.<br /><br /> <b>5) Proximate Cause</b><br /><br /> The state will argue that a personal being burned to death is the foreseeable result of spraying them with gasoline.<br /><br /> Debbie will argue that it was Jon's cigarette that ignited her clothes, which constitutes an independent intervening act which broke the issue of causation.<br /><br /> Debbie's argument will fail, especially if she could in some way tell that Jon was smoking a cigarette, i.e., saw smoke or smelled smoke.<br /><br /> Debbie is the proximate cause of Vickie's death, and is therefore responsible for her homicide.<br /><br /> <b>6) Murder</b><br /><br /> Murder is an unsuccessful homicide, with malice aforethought. Malice is established by showing:<br /><br /> 1) An intent to kill, or<br /><br /> 2) An intent to cause great bodily injury, or<br /><br /> 3) The death resulted from an awareness of and conscious disregard for a high risk to human life, or<br /><br /> 4) The death resulted during the commission of an inherently dangerous felony.<br /><br /> There is a homicide as discussed above. In this case, the state may argue that when Debbie yelled, \"You're not marrying anyone, you slime,\" and then sprayed Vickie with gasoline, she demonstrated an intent to kill, or an intent to cause great bodily harm.<br /><br /> The state may also argue that by spraying gasoline onto a person, Debbie demonstrated an awareness of and disregard for a high risk to human life (Depraved Heart).<br /><br /> The state will be able to establish malice.<br /><br /> <b>7) First Degree Murder/Second Degree Murder</b><br /><br /> Murder that is willful, deliberate and premeditated is First Degree Murder, Second Degree is other types of murder.<br /><br /> If the state can convince a jury that in the brief seconds between seeing Jon and Vickie and spraying her with gas, Debbie decided to kill her, They will establish First Degree Murder.<br /><br /> The state will have a difficult time showing that Debbie reflected upon her act, so she has probably committed second degree murder under a depraved heart theory.<br /><br /><b>8) Voluntary Manslaughter</b><br /><br /> Voluntary manslaughter is an intentional killing of a human being, where malice is mitigated by adequate provocation.<br /><br /> To be adequate, the provocation must be sufficient to enrage the passion of a reasonable person, and the defendant must actually be provoked.<br /><br /> Additionally, there must not have been enough time for a reasonable person to \"cool\" down, and the defendant must not have actually \"cooled\" down.<br /><br /> If the state cannot prove murder, it may argue that Debbie intended to kill Vickie, but that she was provoked by seeing Jon and Vickie passionately kissing in the car next to her. Seeing a boyfriend kiss your best friend is sufficient to enrage the passion of a reasonable person, so Debbie's provocation is reasonable.<br /><br />Additionally there was a break in time between Debbie witnessing the incident and her actions so she did not cool down, nor is there sufficient time for a reasonable person to cool down.<br /><br /> Debbie has committed voluntary manslaughter, if the state can show an intent to kill.<br /><br /><b>9) Involuntary Manslaughter</b><br /><br /> Involuntary manslaughter is an unintended homicide that results from criminal negligence, or the commission of an unlawful act, not amounting to an inherently dangerous felony.<br /><br /> Debbie may argue that at most she has committed an involuntary manslaughter, because she did not intend to kill Vickie, and that Vickie's death resulted from Debbie's criminal negligence or the commission of a battery.<br /><br /> If Debbie did not intend to kill, she may have committed an involuntary manslaughter.<br /><br /><b>10) Attempted murder - Jon</b><br /><br /> An attempt is a substantial step beyond preparation toward the commission of a crime, with the specific intent that the crime be committed. The state may argue that when Debbie sprayed gas on Vickie, while Jon was seated next to her, smoking a cigarette, she took a substantial step toward killing Jon also.<br /><br /> However, there are no facts to suggest that Debbie intended to kill Jon, so the state will not be able to prove an attempted murder of Jon.",
				"State vs. Debbie<br /><br /> State could charge Debbie for criminal assault, battery, and murder (with possibility of first degree murder) as well as involuntary manslaughter.<br /><br /> <b>Murder</b><br /><br /> Issue - <b>Can Debbie be charged with murder of Vickie</b>?<br /><br /> Under criminal law, murder is unlawful homicide, killing of a human being by another, with malice aforethought.<br /><br /> Malice can be found if there is (1) intent to kill, (2) intent to cause great bodily injury, (3) commission of a dangerous felony, felony murder rule, and (4) act with awareness of and disregard for the unjustified risk to human life. The depraved heart murder rule.<br /><br /> Here, this is a killing because Vickie, a human being, died due to the act of another human being, Debbie. The killing is unlawful because it is not justified.<br /><br /> Here malice can also be found because Debbie pointed the gasoline dispenser at Vickie and \"sprayed\" gas on her. This act can be construed as \"intent to kill\" because gasoline is a dangerous substance and everyone knows it would cause death if ignited. Also, there is an intent to cause great injury because even if not ignited, the chemical feature would cause injury to the people.<br /><br /> Therefore Debbie can be charged with murder of Vickie.<br /><br /> Further, if Debbie's act can be construed as deliberated and premeditated, she could also be charged with \"First degree murder.\"<br /><br /> <b>Causation</b><br /><br /> Under criminal, the death of the victim must be <b>actually</b> and <b>proximately</b> caused by defendant's act.<br /><br /> <b>Actual causation</b> is determined by \"but for \" test. Here, but for Debbie's act, Vickie would not have died. Therefore she actually caused Vickie's death.<br /><br /> <b>Proximate causation</b> is determined when the result is foreseeable and there is no superseding intervening event to break the chain of causation. Here, Debbie could argue that Jon's smoking of a cigarette is a superseding event and therefore had broken the chain of causation. However, State would argue that Jon's smoking is foreseeable even if it was unreasonable and spraying gasoline on a person could cause death is also foreseeable.<br /><br /> Therefore, Debbie both actually and proximately caused death of Vickie. Therefore Debbie can be charged with murder.<br /><br /><b>Battery</b><br /><br /> Can Debbie be charged with criminal battery?<br /><br /> Under criminal law, battery is intentional causing harmful or offensive touching.<br /><br /> Here there is an intentional act because Debbie \"sprayed\" gasoline on Vickie. There is also a touching, because gas was put on Vickie by Debbie. There is also a harmful and offensive touching because gasoline is dangerous and [to] be sprayed in public is offensive.<br /><br /> Therefore, Debbie can be charged with Battery.<br /><br /><b>Assault</b><br /><br /> Issue - <b>Can Debbie be charged with criminal assault?</b><br /><br /> Under criminal law, assault can be either attempted battery or attempt to cause apprehension of a battery.<br /><br /> Here, there is an attempt to cause apprehension because Debbie \"shouted\" with \"gasoline dispenser in her hand.\" This would cause a reasonable person to apprehend an offensive or harmful touching.<br /><br /> Therefore, Debbie can be charged with criminal assault.<br /><br /><b>Involuntary Manslaughter</b><br /><br /> Issue - <b>Debbie can be charged with involuntary manslaughter?</b><br /><br /> Under criminal law, involuntary manslaughter is an unintentional killing without malice aforethought done with criminal negligence. Gross reckless or killing during a malum in se felony is not enough to charge for felony murder.<br /><br /> Here, Debbie could also be charged for involuntary manslaughter because her conduct is grossly reckless, i.e., spraying gasoline on another person and caused death.<br /><br /> Therefore, Debbie can be charged with involuntary manslaughter.<br /><br /><b>Defenses</b><br /><br /><b>Mitigation</b><br /><br />Issue - <b>Can Debbie mitigate her killing to voluntary Manslaughter</b> by claiming provocation?<br /><br /> Under criminal law, voluntary manslaughter is an intentional killing without malice aforethought done with adequate provocation: (1) Provoked if it is a reasonable person. (2) Defendant provoked. (3) Not time for cooling down. (4) Defendant did not cool down.<br /><br /> Here, Debbie would argue that she was provoked because she saw Vickie \"passionately kissing\" Jon, Debbie's boyfriend, and she was \"enraged\" to see this. There is also no time to cool down because it happened when Debbie was adding gas, a very short period of time.<br /><br /> Therefore, Debbie would be successful to claim \"heated passion\" killing and mitigate her crime down from murder to voluntary manslaughter.<br /><br /><b>Insanity</b><br /><br /> Under criminal law, insanity is a defense if it negates a required mental state element of the crime charged. Under M'Naghten test, if due to mental disease the defendant did not know what she was doing was wrong, she could be found insane. Under irresistible impulse test, if defendant knew what she was doing was wrong but could not stop herself she can be found insane.<br /><br /> Here, Debbie could claim that she was in \"shock\" and became \"temporarily insane\" and \"could not control herself when she did what she had done.\" However, there is unlikely [sic] she would be successful to raise this defense because there is [sic] no facts to support this claim.<br /><br /> Therefore, Debbie could not successfully use the defense of insanity."

			"essay": "Anna owned a business and stored insured business inventory at a warehouse owned by Bob. Anna was experiencing financial problems and needed funds to pay her creditors. Bob, after hearing of Anna's money problems, suggested that they hire someone to burn down the warehouse since he was planning to build condominiums on the warehouse property and could use the insurance proceeds for the construction of the condominiums. Bob told Anna that he knew someone who would handle burning the warehouse in return for a percentage of the insurance proceeds. Anna agreed and Bob contacted Cindy to burn down the warehouse. Cindy obtained the location of the warehouse from Bob and proceeded to set fire to the warehouse. Unbeknownst to Anna, Bob or Cindy, a homeless person, Daryll, was living in the warehouse. Daryll died as a result of the fire.<br /><br /> After hearing about Daryll's death, Anna and Bob decided not to make any insurance claims. After an investigation Anna, Bob and Cindy were arrested.<br /><br /> With what crimes, if any, might Anna, Bob and Cindy be charged and what defenses, if any, could each assert? Discuss.",
			"sampleAnswers": [
				"<b>I. Anna's Crimes</b><br /><br /><b> A. Conspiracy.</b><br /><br /> A Conspiracy is where two or more people agree/intend to commit an unlawful act and do something in furtherance of the act. Here, after hearing of Anna's money, Bob suggested that they hire someone to burn down the warehouse since Bob wanted to build condominiums on the warehouse property and they could both use the insurance proceeds. Their conspiracy was complete once Bob contacted Cindy to burn down the warehouse - they have now done an act of doing something in furtherance of their unlawful act. Both (sic) Bob, Anna and Cindy will be charged with conspiracy to burn down (arson) the warehouse.<br /><br /> <b>1 Pinkerton's Rule.</b> This rule states that all co-conspirators will be responsible for the unlawful acts of other co-conspirators done in furtherance of the conspiracy. Here, Anna will be held responsible for all acts done by Bob and Cindy to further their unlawful conspiracy.<br /><br /><b>B. Solicitation.</b><br /><br /> Solicitation is when one encourages, asks, incites another into committing an unlawful act. Here Anna would be charged with the solicitation of Cindy because Bob asked Cindy to burn down the warehouse. However, when Cindy agreed she then merged the crime of solicitation into conspiracy.<br /><br /><b>C. Attempted Insurance Fraud.</b> <br /><br />To be charged with the crime of attempt the defendant must specifically intend to commit the unlawful act and do something in furtherance to show that the defendant actually intended the crime. Here, Anna will be charged with the intent to commit insurance fraud. Because Anna and Bob agreed to commit arson in order to collect insurance money. The attempt will be considered complete when Bob asked Cindy to burn down the warehouse and Cindy set fire to the warehouse as instructed. Even though Anna and Bob decided not to make any insurance claims they will still be charged with attempted insurance fraud. It was because Daryll the homeless man was killed that they did not want anyone to be suspicious of them. And possible guilt of him dying that caused Anna and Bob to not go through with their insurance claims. Anna will be charged with attempt to commit insurance fraud.<br /><br /><b>D. Arson</b> is when the defendant intentionally burns down the house of another. Modernly, basically all structures are included, including one's own business or property in order to collect insurance money. The burning must be at least some type of charring to suffice, blackening will not. Here, Cindy set the fire to the warehouse and we assume that it was burned because it was significant enough to cause Daryll's death and burning also qualified because Anna and Bob could collect insurance claims. The burning of the warehouse was intentional as Anna and Bob conspired to have it burned down by asking Cindy to burn it down for a percentage of the insurance proceeds. Anna also burned her own property (business inventory) and the burning is supposed to be of another's property. However if one commits arson with the intention of collecting insurance money then this qualifies as arson because Anna did so for illegal purposes. She also destroyed other people's property that was destroyed in the warehouse.<br /><br /><b>E. Murder.</b> <br /><br />A homicide is the unlawful killing of another human being. It will be considered murder if malice is proved.<br /><br /> <b>1. Malice.</b> <br /><br />Malice will be proved if any of the following four elements are met: 1) intent to kill (premeditation and deliberation); 2) intent to seriously injure; 3) wanton and willful conduct (depraved heart); and 4) a killing done in connection with a dangerous felony . Here, the state would most likely focus on a killing done in connection with a dangerous felony as this element and intent to kill/murder the defendant is eligible for a first degree murder charge.<br /><br /> <b>2. Felony-Murder.</b> <br /><br />Felony murder is charged when the defendant kills another human being in the course of a dangerous felony. For a felony to qualify the felony must be considered extremely dangerous so as to show dangers to other people. Most jurisdictions list dangerous felonies as a killing during the commission of arson, rape, robbery, burglary or a kidnaping. It does not matter that you did not intend to kill another person but because of the dangerous situation involved in committing the felony a death could foreseeably occur because of the defendant's actions. Here, Anna conspired to commit the crime of arson, burning down the warehouse and by doing so she was committing a dangerous felony when Cindy went ahead and set fire to the warehouse. Because fire is considered dangerous, a chance of loss of life is easily foreseeable, then Anna will be charged with the felony murder of Daryll.<br /><br /><b>1. Involuntary manslaughter.</b> <br /><br />Anna will claim that by her planning to burn down the warehouse and Cindy burning it down that they did not intend that Daryll would die. That the fire was an act of criminal negligence and the felony-murder charge should be reduced to involuntary manslaughter. However, this is an unlikely defense because Anna planned on committing arson which qualifies as a dangerous felony because it was foreseeable that another person might be seriously injured or die because of their actions.<br /><br />II. <b>Bob's Crimes.</b><br /><br /> <b>A.

				"<b>People v. Anna</b><br /><br /> <b>Conspiracy Liability</b><br /><br /> At common law a conspiracy is an agreement between two or more persons to commit an overt illegal act or a legal act by illegal means. Modernly an overt act is required. The Warton rule requires one more person in the agreement than is necessary to commit the crime. A party may withdraw from a conspiracy provided the withdraw [sic] is done voluntary [sic] (without duress of immediate apprehension), is disclosed to all other parties of the conspiracy, and is in sufficient time before the crime is committed. A party to a conspiracy is liable for the foreseeable crimes committed by the other parties to the conspiracy prior to the withdrawal.<br /><br /> Here Bob and Anna formed an agreement because \"Anna agreed.\" The agreement was to burn down the warehouse, an arson. They committed an overt act by contracting with Cindy to burn down the building. Arson is the malicious burning of the dwelling of another. Modernly, the dwelling has been expanded to including most structures and other places, i.e. forest, etc. . . . Likewise the structure can be the defendant's own, if done with criminal intent, i.e., insurance fraud.<br /><br /> Therefore, Anna conspired with Bob to burn the warehouse with the intent of defrauding the insurance company. (At common law, the act of the arson would not be a crime since the structure was not a dwelling, but the intended result of insurance fraud would be a crime, supra, and therefore would still result in a conspiracy.<br /><br /> <b>CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT LARCENY/FRAUD</b><br /><br /> <b>Conspiracy</b>, defined supra.<br /><br /> Larceny is the trespasser taking and carrying away of the personal property of another with the intent to permanently deprive. Fraud is larceny by trick through misrepresentation of a fact to another to induce the other to give up personal property.<br /><br /> Here Anna (and Bob) intended to burn down the warehouse to collect upon Bob's insurance policy, the personal property of another, the insurance company. Anna agreed to the act. The intent was to defraud the insurance company, an illegal act. By contracting with Cindy an overt act was commenced.<br /><br /> Anna will be charged with Conspiracy to commit fraud.<br /><br /> <b>CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT SOLICITATION OF A CRIME</b><br /><br /> <b>Conspiracy</b>, defined supra.<br /><br /> Solicitation is the act of urging or encouraging another to commit a criminal act, with the intent of the act being committed. The solicitation can be of any criminal act.<br /><br /> Modernly, however, at common law, the solicitation must have been for the commission of a felony. If the act solicitated is committed the solicitation is merged into the crime. Here Bob and Anna agreed to solicit Cindy to commit an arson, a crime. When Bob and Anna contracted with Cindy to burn the warehouse they committed an overt act and can be charged with conspiracy to solicit Cindy to commit arson. Since the arson was committed, infra, the solicitation will merge into the arson.<br /><br /> <b>ARSON</b><br /><br /> Defined Supra.<br /><br /> <b>Accomplice Liability</b><br /><br /> An accomplice in the first degree is one who is present at the time of the commission of the crime who may not actually be the principal. An accomplice in the second degree is not present at the time of the crime, but who has the intent to commit the crime and who aids or abets the others in the commission of the crime. Here, Anna was neither present, [n]or apparently aided nor abetted in the arson and therefore would not be liable as [an] accomplice. However, as a member of a conspiracy, supra, all parties are liable for the foreseeable criminal acts of the other parties. Here Anna conspired to burn the structure. If Cindy committed Arson, Anna would be held liable.<br /><br /> Based on conspiracy liability, at common law Anna would not be guilty of Arson because the building was not a dwelling. However, modernly the dwelling has been expanded and would include the warehouse. Because Cindy intentionally (maliciously) burned the warehouse, Anna would be charged with Arson.<br /><br /> <b>MURDER.</b><br /><br /> Murder is the unlawful killing of another human being with malice aforethought. Malice aforethought is the intentional killing or implied killing through infliction of great bodily harm, unreasonable risk to human life (depraved heart), commission of felony or in some jurisdictions resisting lawful arrest. There must be a causation between the act and the killing.<br /><br /> All murder is second degree unless it is premeditated, killing by enumerated means, or during the commission of a dangerous felony. Then it is statutory first degree murder. Arson, supra, is a dangerous felony.<br /><br /> Here a killing of another occurred because Daryll died. The killing was the actual cause because but for the arson, Daryll would not have died. The arson is the proximate cause of the killing because there were not unforeseen intervening factors that negated the arson as the cause in fact of Daryll's death. Therefore the killing was caused by the arson.<br /><br /> Felony first degree murder is applicable because arson is a dangerous felony. Daryll's death is a result of and occurred during the arson. Further, since a conspirator is responsible for the crimes committed by the other parties to the conspiracy, that are foreseeable, which a death is foreseeable during an arson, Anna would be responsible for Daryll's death and charged with Statutory first degree murder.<br /><br /> Alternative second degree murder. In the event the jury does not believe that it was foreseeable Daryll would be in there because the building was a warehouse and people do not live in warehouses, the jury could find Anna responsible for second degree murder under the theory of unjustifiable risk to human life since the burning of any structure is an uncontrollable event and the likelihood is the fire can get out of control, the agreement to burn the warehouse places human life in unjustifiable risk.<br /><br /> <b>DEFENSE TO MURDER:</b> <br /><br /><b>A mistake of fact</b>, i.e., the warehouse is empty, does not apply because a mistake of a fact is not a defense to a general intent crime, which second degree murder and arson are both (sic).<br /><br /> There are not other defenses to the crime that are applicable. <b>ATTEMPT FRAUD:</b> An attempt is a significant step towards the commission of a crime coupled with the intent to commit the crime. An attempt can be for any form, but the defendant must have the specific intent of desiring the commission of a[n] actual crime. Fraud, supra, is a crime. Anna intended to partake in the fraud with Bob of his insurance company. Here [sic] and Bob took a significant step towards the crime then they hired Cindy to burn down the building. Anna will argue that the significant step to the fraud is the filing of the insurance claims and because they did not they did not take a significant step and therefore are not guilty of attempt[ed] fraud. The prosecution will argue that one [sic] the burning occurred, the attempt was in place, and it was too late to back out since a withdrawal of an attempt is generally not a defense as the crime is the \"attempt\" and the specific means to commit that crime. If not for the burning of the warehouse, Anna could argue the significant step did not occur. However, Anna will be charged with attempt to commit fraud.<br /><br /> <b>PEOPLE V. BOB:</b> Bob will be charged for the same reasons as set forth above for Anna with crimes of conspiracy to commit arson, conspiracy to commit fraud, murder and attempted fraud. In addition Bob will be charged with solicitation, supra, of arson, and fraud.<br /><br /> Solicitation to commit arson, for the same reasons set forth in Anna. (In addition Bob solicited Anna to commit arson.) Bob will not be charged with solicitation to commit arson as the arson occurred and the solicitation is merged into that crime.<br /><br /> However, Bob did encourage Anna to commit fraud by suggesting they hire someone to burn down the warehouse and collect the insurance proceeds, since the fraud was not committed, Bob will be charged with solicitation of Anna to commit fraud.<br /><br /> <b>PEOPLE V. CINDY:</b> As set forth above Cindy will be charged with conspiracy to commit arson, arson and murder."
