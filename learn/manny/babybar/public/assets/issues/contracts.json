The printed phrase \"Available for a Limited Time Only\" appeared at the top of the brochure.

However, the salesperson told her that the set was out of stock and that Seller could not sell her another at the $300 price. Two months later, Buyer purchased the same model set from another dealer for $450.<br /><br /> Buyer wishes to sue Seller, seeking damages for lost profits. Buyer intends to allege that she lost customers because she has not had television in the station for the past two months.<br /><br /> What theory or theories for recovery of damages will Buyer assert in her complaint and what is her likelihood of success on each theory?

The court abhors a waste and will reduce Sam's debt by the difference between what the building now is worth and what it would have been worth if the contract was fulfilled as expected."

Paintco's president published an advertisement in a local trade paper asking paint suppliers to place bids with Paintco for the furnishing of 10,000 gallons of special paint in accordance with the government's specifications. The advertisement, published March 1, stated that Paintco was going to bid on the government job, and asked all interested parties to submit their bids, in writing, on or before April 15, specifying that the bids were to be \"irrevocable for 30 days.\"<br /><br /> On the evening of April 15, Ritzcorp's president telephoned Paintco and submitted Ritzcorp's bid orally by leaving a message on Paintco's answering machine, which was equipped with a voice-decoding feature that translated telephone messages into a written printout. The telephone message, which Paintco's president both heard and read that evening, identified the speaker as Ritzcorp's president and stated that his company would supply 8,500 gallons of paint to Paintco at a price of $10 per gallon. The telephone message also stated that the bid price did not include the cost of delivery, that any acceptance of Ritzcorp's bid must be in writing and must be received by Ritzcorp on or before May 1.<br /><br /> Because Ritzcorp's bid was the lowest, Paintco used it to compute the price of its own irrevocable bid to the government the next day. On May 1, Paintco was notified that it had won the government contract. The same day it mailed a letter to Ritzcorp stating: \"We accept your offer of April 15, but ask that the paint be fully warranted as to quality and that you arrange for delivery of 10,000 gallons of the paint to the job site.\" The letter arrived at Ritzcorp's offices on May 2. Ritzcorp dispatched an e-mail to Paintco that very afternoon, stating that in light of an unexpected rise in the cost of ingredients it was only prepared to offer a price per gallon of $12, and that any paint Paintco chose to purchase would be sold \"as is,\" without any warranties. After subsequent talks between the parties failed to resolve their differences, Paintco promptly secured a commitment from the next lowest bidder, BrushCorp, to supply all 10,000 gallons at a price of $14 per gallon. Paintco then immediately wrote a letter to Ritzcorp declaring that Ritzcorp had repudiated its contractual commitment to supply paint, and threatening to hold it accountable for all damages. Paintco completed the government job using the paint supplied by BrushCorp.<br /><br /> What action(s) can Paintco reasonably assert against Ritzcorp, and what would be the likely result of these action(s)?

He was very upset to find that Babe Ruth's autograph had been all but worn off as a result.<br /><br /> Rick learned that Hannah had been seen coming out of Rick's cabin a few minutes before the baseball game and that she had sat near the ball bag before the start of the game. He told Hannah that he would not let her ride home until she admitted what she had done. Very upset, Hannah continually protested her innocence until Rick finally told her at 6:30 p.m. that she could get her bike and ride home. She lived approximately one-half mile from Camp.<br /><br /> When Hannah's parents asked the Camp Director why their daughter had been so late in getting home, the Director told them what had happened. The Director added that he would never have allowed Rick to keep Hannah so late had he been aware of it. He also told Hannah's parents that Hannah had not taken Rick's ball. In fact, her eight-year-old campmate, Jessie, confessed that she had placed Rick's autographed baseball in the ball bag.<br /><br /> 1. On what theory or theories, if any, might an action be brought on Hannah's behalf against Rick, what defenses might Rick assert, and what is the likely outcome? Discuss fully.<br /><br /> 2. On what theory or theories, if any, might an action be brought on Hannah's behalf against Camp, what defense might Camp assert, and what is the likely outcome? Discuss fully.",

Under the contract, Apple was required to deliver on the first day of each month the quantity of apples that Bakery required. The contract price was $5,000 per month, payable upon delivery of each shipment.<br /><br /> Apple delivered the required quantity each month for the first six months. At the end of the sixth month, Apple assigned its contract with Bakery to FruitCo, which undertook to deliver the requisite quantities for the remainder of the contract term. Bakery, having some doubts about FruitCo's reliability, wrote both Apple and FruitCo a letter in which Bakery stated, \"I want to be absolutely sure that both Apple and FruitCo will guarantee that I receive the quantity of apples that I require each month.\"<br /><br /> Neither Apple nor FruitCo responded to Bakery's letter. In the seventh and eighth months of the contract, FruitCo made deliveries that were substantially short of the quantity that Bakery required and that Apple had previously delivered. Nevertheless, Bakery accepted and paid for the short shipments.<br /><br /> At the end of the eighth month, Bakery entered into a contract with Davis Farms (\"Davis\") to supply Bakery with its requirements for apples for the remaining four months of the year. The contract price was $7,500 per month, payable upon delivery of each shipment. Bakery wrote a letter to Apple and FruitCo informing them that Bakery would no longer accept any apple shipments from either of them.<br /><br /> Bakery then sued both Apple and FruitCo for breach of contract to recover the difference between the Apple/FruitCo contract price and the Davis contract price.<br /><br /> Apple defended on the ground that, after its assignment to FruitCo, it was no longer liable to Bakery.

Under this contract, Ellen was to do the electrical work for the building for $15,000. At the time she entered into the contract, Ellen was not aware of Bill's on-time bonus, but learned about it before she was to begin the job.<br /><br /> In the midst of the job, after receiving $3,000 in progress payments, Ellen decided she could not profitably do the electrical work for $15,000 and quit. Bill looked diligently for an electrical contractor to complete the work at the lowest cost. The only electrical contractor Bill could locate was Roger. Roger demanded $20,000 to complete the work.

He decided to use a particular product called \"Austin Brown Stone\" for the exterior walls, and estimated he would need about 100 tons of stone.<br /><br /> Jack drafted a contract to present to Stone-Co, a local stone distributor, in which Jack agreed: (i) to buy all the Austin Brown Stone he needs to build the exterior walls of his house, (ii) at a price of $200 per ton, (iii) to be delivered to his property in 5-ton lots within 10 days following each request for 5 tons, (iv) to be paid for upon delivery. To ensure timely deliveries, Jack included a liquidated damages clause which provided that Stone-Co would pay $5,000 per day for each day that any requested delivery is late.<br /><br /> Jack signed and dropped off the contract to Stone-Co for its review and signature. That evening, the Stone-Co salesperson, knowing that Austin Brown Stone is often not easily obtained, wrote the following just below Jack's liquidated damages clause: \"Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Stone-Co has difficulty getting Austin Brown Stone, Stone-Co may substitute Austin White Stone.\"<br /><br /> The Stone-Co salesperson then signed the contract and returned it to Jack the next day.

Although it could be imported from Canada, importing it would add $25 per ton to Stone-Co's expenses and reduce its profit margin.<br /><br /> Ten days after Jack's order, Stone-Co delivered Austin White Stone with a note stating that Austin Brown Stone was not available in the U.S., and a demand for payment at the new price of $225 per ton. Jack immediately called the Stone-Co salesperson, stating he would not accept the substitution because Austin White Stone is a completely different product.<br /><br /> Jack contracted with another supplier for Austin Brown Stone at $225 per ton.

Mary and her friend Dan both assumed that it was a genuine autographed game ball used in that 1967 Super Bowl. Dan offered Mary $10,000 for the ball. In response, Mary wrote in pen on a napkin, \"Dan agrees to buy Mary's Bart Starr football for $10,000 on or before December 1, 2016.\" Dan signed the napkin in pen, and Mary kept the napkin without signing it.<br /><br /> As December approached, Dan was unable to come up with $10,000. Dan's friend Ed, who also assumed the ball was a genuine autographed 1967 Super Bowl game ball, wanted the ball, so Dan typed a document which read, \"Dan hereby assigns all of his rights to buy Mary's football to Ed; Ed hereby assumes all of Dan's obligations under Dan's contract with Mary to buy her football.\" Dan and Ed both signed three copies, each keeping one copy and sending one copy to Mary.<br /><br /> After some internet research, Ed discovered that while the Bart Starr autograph on the football was genuine, the football was not the type used in the 1967 game; it was instead a consumer product manufactured after 2005. The ball is worth about $1,000. Dan and Ed no longer wanted the ball. On December 2, 2016, Mary sued Dan and Ed for breach of contract.<br /><br /> 1. Can Mary prevail on her lawsuit?

Instead, the football was a consumer product manufactured after 2005. Thus, the football was not used in the first Super Bowl in 1967. This would have made the football worth $1000, instead of $10,000. Both Mary and Dan believed the football was used in the first Super Bowl in 1967 and that is why Mary and Dan believed the football was $10,000. Since both parties were both mistaken about a material fact, then the parties may consider to rescind the contract.<br /><br /> Therefore, there was a mutual mistake."

The court would not likely order Dan and Ed to purchase a ball worth $1000, not the bargained for ball that was bargained for, at a price ten times what it is worth. As most of the time the court will not dispute the terms of the bargain, this would give Mary a huge windfall and is not likely to be upheld by the court.<br /><br /> Dan and Ed would be excused from performing the contract under the doctrine of frustration of purpose."
