The printed phrase \"Available for a Limited Time Only\" appeared at the top of the brochure. As the salesperson handed Buyer the brochure he said, \"I think you'll find no one will beat our price.\"<br /><br /> Not finding a better price, Buyer returned to Seller's one week later to buy the television set. However, the salesperson told her that the set was out of stock and that Seller could not sell her another at the $300 price. Two months later, Buyer purchased the same model set from another dealer for $450.<br /><br /> Buyer wishes to sue Seller, seeking damages for lost profits. Buyer intends to allege that she lost customers because she has not had television in the station for the past two months.<br /><br /> What theory or theories for recovery of damages will Buyer assert in her complaint and what is her likelihood of success on each theory?

Seller will argue that the printed phrase \"Available for a limited time only\" suggests only for a period of time in which Seller has inventory. Also, this phrase suggests a short period of time. Buyer, on the other hand, would argue that one week, the time in which the Buyer returned, is within a \"limited time\" and furthermore one week is within a reasonable time as contemplated by the UCC, which cuts off firm offers without consideration at three months.
