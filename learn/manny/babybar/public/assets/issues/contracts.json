			"essay": "Buyer opened a new automobile service station earlier this year. Buyer wanted to buy a television set for the station so her customers could watch television while she worked on their cars.<br /><br /> Buyer found the television set she wanted at Seller Sets, Inc. (\"Seller\"), a television set retailer. A Seller salesperson told Buyer she could purchase the set for $300. Buyer replied that she would like to \"shop around\". The salesperson then wrote \"Seller Sets, Inc. - $300\" on a sales brochure describing the set and gave the brochure to Buyer. The printed phrase \"Available for a Limited Time Only\" appeared at the top of the brochure. As the salesperson handed Buyer the brochure he said, \"I think you'll find no one will beat our price.\"<br /><br /> Not finding a better price, Buyer returned to Seller's one week later to buy the television set. However, the salesperson told her that the set was out of stock and that Seller could not sell her another at the $300 price. Two months later, Buyer purchased the same model set from another dealer for $450.<br /><br /> Buyer wishes to sue Seller, seeking damages for lost profits. Buyer intends to allege that she lost customers because she has not had television in the station for the past two months.<br /><br /> What theory or theories for recovery of damages will Buyer assert in her complaint and what is her likelihood of success on each theory? Discuss.",

The offer remains open for the stated period of time not to exceed three months or for a reasonable period of time if no time is stated, again not to exceed three months.<br /><br /> Here, Seller is a merchant as discussed above. Seller wrote on the T.V. sales brochure that described the set \"Seller Sets, Inc. $300.\" Buyer will argue that this is a signed writing because of Seller's handwritten note. Seller, on the other hand, will argue that Seller's writing is not a signature. In general, the UCC favors contracts and a trier of fact may determine that Seller's handwritten notes with the words \"Seller Sets\" constitutes a signing.<br /><br /> Here, no specific time is given for the length of the firm offer. Seller will argue that the printed phrase \"Available for a limited time only\" suggests only for a period of time in which Seller has inventory. Also, this phrase suggests a short period of time. Buyer, on the other hand, would argue that one week, the time in which the Buyer returned, is within a \"limited time\" and furthermore one week is within a reasonable time as contemplated by the UCC, which cuts off firm offers without consideration at three months. Because one week is a reasonable time for holding open an offer to sell a TV, Seller must keep its offer open for one week.<br /><br /> Therefore, Seller gave Buyer a merchant firm offer that was open for at least one week."
