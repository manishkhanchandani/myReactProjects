			"essay": "Buyer opened a new automobile service station earlier this year. Buyer wanted to buy a television set for the station so her customers could watch television while she worked on their cars.<br /><br /> Buyer found the television set she wanted at Seller Sets, Inc. (\"Seller\"), a television set retailer. A Seller salesperson told Buyer she could purchase the set for $300. Buyer replied that she would like to \"shop around\". The salesperson then wrote \"Seller Sets, Inc. - $300\" on a sales brochure describing the set and gave the brochure to Buyer. The printed phrase \"Available for a Limited Time Only\" appeared at the top of the brochure. As the salesperson handed Buyer the brochure he said, \"I think you'll find no one will beat our price.\"<br /><br /> Not finding a better price, Buyer returned to Seller's one week later to buy the television set. However, the salesperson told her that the set was out of stock and that Seller could not sell her another at the $300 price. Two months later, Buyer purchased the same model set from another dealer for $450.<br /><br /> Buyer wishes to sue Seller, seeking damages for lost profits. Buyer intends to allege that she lost customers because she has not had television in the station for the past two months.<br /><br /> What theory or theories for recovery of damages will Buyer assert in her complaint and what is her likelihood of success on each theory? Discuss.",
			"sampleAnswers": [
				"I. What law applies: <b>Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) or common law</b>? <br /><br />The UCC is the governing law for the sale of goods. Goods are movable items and do not include services, real estate, or intangibles. <br /><br />Here, the governing law is the UCC.<br /><br /><b>2. Is Seller a merchant as defined by the UCC?</b><br /><br />The UCC defines merchant as someone who trades the types of goods in question or holds themselves out to be knowledgeable regarding the goods.<br /><br />Here, Seller is a television set retailer and is clearly a merchant.<br /><br />Note: Seller's salesperson, since acting within the scope of her/his employment, binds Seller Sets, Inc. to any  contracts/offers, etc., that she makes (respondeat superior).<br /><br /><b>3. Did Buyer and Seller have a contract for the sale of a TV set for $300?</b><br /><br />A contract consists of an offer, an acceptance, and consideration. An offer is a manifestation to be presently found or committed, communicated to specific offerees, with definite subject matter and material terms. Under the UCC, quantity and subject matter are generally the only two terms required.<br /><br />Then explain offer and acceptance in 2 paragraphs and then conclude with: <br /><br />Therefore, as of the time of the Buyer's first visit to Seller Sets, there is no contract between Seller and Buyer.<br /><br /><b>Offer?</b><br /><br /> An offer is a manifestation to be presently found or committed, communicated to specific offerees, with definite subject matter and material terms. Under the UCC, quantity and subject matter are generally the only two terms required.<br /><br />Here, the salesperson clearly offers Buyer the television set for $300 because he told buyer she could purchase the set for $300.<br /><br /><b>Acceptance</b><br /><br /> Acceptance is the manifest willingness to be presently bound to a valid offer. It can be express or implied. Under the UCC acceptance can occur by a means stipulated by the offer, or if no such means is provided, in any reasonable manner.<br /><br /> Here, Buyer clearly does not accept Seller's offer because Buyer states that she would like to \"shop around.\"<br /><br /> Therefore, as of the time of the Buyer's first visit to Seller Sets, there is no contract between Seller and Buyer.<br /><br /><b>4. Did Seller make a Merchant Firm Offer to Buyer?</b> <br /><br />Under the UCC, an offer can remain open if supported by consideration (an options contract) or if a merchant firm offer is made. A merchant firm offer occurs when a merchant makes a signed writing to keep an offer open. The offer remains open for the stated period of time not to exceed three months or for a reasonable period of time if no time is stated, again not to exceed three months.<br /><br /> Here, Seller is a merchant as discussed above. Seller wrote on the T.V. sales brochure that described the set \"Seller Sets, Inc. $300.\" Buyer will argue that this is a signed writing because of Seller's handwritten note. Seller, on the other hand, will argue that Seller's writing is not a signature. In general, the UCC favors contracts and a trier of fact may determine that Seller's handwritten notes with the words \"Seller Sets\" constitutes a signing.<br /><br /> Here, no specific time is given for the length of the firm offer. Seller will argue that the printed phrase \"Available for a limited time only\" suggests only for a period of time in which Seller has inventory. Also, this phrase suggests a short period of time. Buyer, on the other hand, would argue that one week, the time in which the Buyer returned, is within a \"limited time\" and furthermore one week is within a reasonable time as contemplated by the UCC, which cuts off firm offers without consideration at three months. Because one week is a reasonable time for holding open an offer to sell a TV, Seller must keep its offer open for one week.<br /><br /> Therefore, Seller gave Buyer a merchant firm offer that was open for at least one week.<br /><br /><b>Detrimental Reliance</b><br /><br /> In the event that Seller was not found to have made a merchant firm offer, Buyer may argue that she detrimentally, reasonably, and foreseeably relied upon Seller's statement that T.V.'s at $300 would be available.* If so, this detrimental reliance in effect provides the consideration to keep Seller's offer open.<br /><br /> *Here, in addition to the facts pertaining to the merchant firm offer, Seller says Buyer will not find anyone that can beat Seller's price.<br /><br /><b>5. What damages can Buyer recover if Seller violated its merchant firm offer?</b><br /><br /> Assuming a merchant firm offer was made by Seller that stayed open for a week, Seller broke that offer when Buyer returned a week later to purchase the TV (Salesperson tells Buyer TV out of stock and could not sell Buyer one at $300.)<br /><br />  <b>Expectation Damages</b><br /><br /> Parties to a contract are awarded expectation damages - damages to make them whole so that they receive the benefit of their bargain. Under the UCC, when a seller breaches, by not providing the goods to buyer, buyer can cover, that is purchase an identical or equivalent good and the seller owes the buyer expectation damages equal to the difference in prices.<br /><br /> Here, Buyer covers her purchase by buying an identical TV two months later at a $150 increase in price ($450 - $150). Seller may argue that Buyer waited too long to cover herself and, if TV prices increased during this time, Seller should not have to pay for such increases. Here, there are no facts to support this and therefore Seller owes Buyer $150 in expectation damages.<br /><br /><b>Consequential Damages</b><br /><br /> Consequential Damages may be awarded to the non-breaching party if at the time of contract formation (in this case the merchant firm offer) the nonbreaching party makes clear to the breaching party that there are special circumstances that would not be obvious that would cause harm if the contract were breached.<br /><br /> Here, Buyer does not tell Seller that the TV is necessary to retaining customers at Buyer's service station, and Seller would have no reason to know this. Furthermore, Buyer could have covered much sooner than two months in order to mitigate damages (that is, loss of customers to the service station). In addition, Seller would argue that Buyer's consequential damages are too speculative, too remote, and cannot be reasonably determined by a court because it would be hard to determine whether the lack of a TV resulted in a specific number of customers not using Buyer's service station.<br /><br /> Therefore, Buyer will not recover consequential damages.",
				"<b>I. Governing Law - UCC or Common Law?</b><br /><br />If Buyer can establish that a contract exists, it will be governed by the UCC because this is a contract for the sale of goods, a TV (a movable object).<br /><br /><b>II. Do the parties have a contract?</b><br /><br /> <b>A. Has there been an offer?</b><br /><br /> Seller is a party that deal in \"goods of the kind,\" and as such is defined within the UCC as a merchant. Specifically, Seller is a TV set retailer, as stated in the fact pattern. Therefore, the special rules for merchants' offers will apply. The salesperson for Seller, as an agent of Seller, has provided Buyer with a brochure describing the set, and salesperson wrote \"Seller Sets, Inc. - $300\" on the brochure. Thus, the elements of a Merchant's Firm Offer are established: 1) price, 2) quantity (implied to be one), 3) description of the product stated with specificity, and 4) signed by the merchant. The courts have held that a written or printed business name on the estimate or brochure may be held to construe a signed offer. Further, under the objective theory of contracts, the brochure and statements made by salesperson would induce a reasonable person to believe that had the power to presently accept Seller's offer to sell one TV for $300. Under the Merchant's Firm Offer rule, the merchant must hold the offer open to the offeree for a \"reasonable time,\" not to exceed 3 months. Therefore, it would appear that there has been an offer.<br /><br /><b>B. Is the offer still open?</b><br /><br />As stated supra, under the Merchant's Firm offer rule, the merchant is required to hold an offer open for a reasonable amount of time. Under these facts, Seller had reason to know that Buyer intended to \"shop around\" a bit, and this is the reason Seller's salesperson provided the brochure. The words, \"Available for a Limited Time Only\" appeared on the brochure. Thus, when Buyer returned to purchase the set he may have believed that this was within the \"Limited Time.\" Since this is an ambiguous statement as to how long the offer will remain open, it will be up to the court to determine if Buyer acted reasonably. Ordinarily, a merchant's firm offer must be held open for a period not to exceed 3 months unless unambiguously stated in the offer. Seller's offer is ambiguous on its face, and this will be an issue for the court.<br /><br /> <b>C. If the offer is still open -</b> <br /><br /> If the court rules that one week was a reasonable time in which Buyer could return and expect to be able to accept Seller's offer, then her act of returning to the store prepared to make a perfect tender to purchase the set would have been an acceptance on Buyer's part. Thus, a contract would have been formed.<br /><br /> <b>D. If the offer was no longer open - </b><br /><br /> If the court rules that it would be unreasonable for Buyer to expect to be able to purchase the set one week later, in light of the fact that the brochure clearly indicated the special price was available for a limited time only, Buyer's actions would be construed as an ineffective attempt to accept the offer. Under these facts, no contract would have been formed.<br /><br />III. If Buyer was reasonable in returning to the store one week later to purchase the set, offered perfect tender, and expected to make a contract with Seller for one TV, she has accepted the contract. When she was informed by Seller that there were no more in stock, this was, in effect, a breach on the part of Seller. Since it went directly to the essence of the contract (the TV), it is a material breach on the part of Seller. Thus, Buyer could reasonably sue for damages.<br /><br /> Under the Merchants' Firm Offer rule, which appears to be in effect here, it is likely that the court will rule in favor for Buyer as to whether the Seller should have expected his brochure to induce reliance on the part of Buyer. A reasonable person in Buyer's position would expect that he would be able to accept the offer and form a contract with Seller. Thus, Buyer will be owed some damages based on his reliance on Seller's statements.<br /><br /><b>A. Reliance - Compensatory Damages</b><br /><br /> Buyer will first state that based on her reliance on Seller's offer, she expected to be able to purchase this model of TV for $300. Ultimately, she had to pay $450 for the same model. Thus, she should be compensated for the difference in what she actually paid and what she would have paid had the contract with Seller not been breached. This amount, $150, is her compensatory damages. Buyer would be under an obligation to mitigate her damages, and there are no facts presented to indicate either that she did or did not. The fact that she waited two months to make the purchase of a TV set, that it was the same model and that it was 50% more expensive would all be factors for the court to consider in determining if Buyer was reasonable in her attempt to mitigate her damages. She seems to have a strong case, given her reliance on a merchant's firm offer.<br /><br /><b>B. Lost profits</b><br /><br /> Damages for lost profits must be established with reasonable certainty, and are designed to place the plaintiff in the position they would have been in had the contract been adequately performed. Here, that would mean, if Buyer had been able to purchase the TV set from Seller as originally desired, how would that have affected her business profits? Typically, lost profit damages are very difficult to establish absent significant historical data to indicate some trend or pattern. Since this was a new business, for Buyer, it will be especially difficult for her to establish with the requisite specificity exactly how her business was harmed by the lack of a TV in the waiting area of the station. Therefore, it is unlikely that she will recover damages for lost profits.<br /><br /> <b>IV. Seller's Defenses to whether there is a contract -</b><br /><br /> Buyer will be owed nothing if Seller can prove that there was no contract. This might be achieved in either of two ways: 1) That Buyer's reliance was unreasonable, and 2) claiming the statute of frauds as a defense to formation.<br /><br /> <b>A. Buyer's unreasonable expectation to contract</b><br /><br /> As discussed supra, whether Buyer's expectation that she could presently accept Seller's offer via the brochure is a matter for the court. Seller will argue that the printed \"Limited Time Only\" should not have induced any reliance on Buyer's part that she could expect to return one week later and purchase the TV set.<br /><br /> <b>B. Statute of Frauds</b><br /><br /> Seller may raise an issue with the statute of frauds, but this would be ineffective, since the Statute of Frauds provision applying to goods is applicable only to goods of $500 or more. The TV was offered for $300, and therefore, is outside the Statute of Frauds."

Furthermore, Buyer could have covered much sooner than two months in order to mitigate damages (that is, loss of customers to the service station). In addition, Seller would argue that Buyer's consequential damages are too speculative, too remote, and cannot be reasonably determined by a court because it would be hard to determine whether the lack of a TV resulted in a specific number of customers not using Buyer's service station.<br /><br /> Therefore, Buyer will not recover consequential damages."

			"sampleAnswers": [
				"<b>1. Windco v. Sam - Full Price</b><br /><br />Windco is suing on the contract (K) and must first show that all enforceable K was formed, i.e., mutual assent, consideration & no defenses to K formation.<br /><br /><b>A. Mutual assent.</b><br /><br /><b>1. Offer</b>.<br /><br /><b>a. Advertisement.</b> An advertisement is generally not an offer absent an identified group of offerees to which the ad is communicated, quantity & subject matter. Here, the ad is likely not the offer.<br /><br /><b>2. Sam's writing.</b> An offer is a manifestation of present interest to be bound to sufficiently definite essential terms. Sam's writing contained quantity (30), subject matter (window frames), price ($100 each) and his identity. His note to have installation within 15 days manifested his intent to be bound. This was an offer.<br /><br /><b>2. Acceptance.</b><br /><br /><b>a. Governing law.</b> Acceptance and terms included turn on governing law. Here 85%, or the main purpose of the K, involved the sale of goods. Goods are moveable personal property; here, window frames. Sale of goods are governed by UCC.<br /><br /><b>b. Acknowledgment of Order.</b> An acceptance is a manifestation by the offeror of present intent to be bound to the terms of the offer. Here, Windco sent an acknowledgment of order. Typically, an acknowledgment of receipt of order is not sufficient manifestation to be bound, so this was not necessarily an acceptance. However, UCC permits acceptance by any reasonable means.<br /><br /><b>c. Installing.</b> Therefore, the fact that Windco performed and installed the frames will be Windco's acceptance, because acceptance can be made by conduct.<br /><br /><b>3. Terms.</b><br /><br /><b>a. Merchants.</b> A merchant is one who deals in the course of business with goods of the kind or holds himself out as having special skills in the area. Here, Windco was in the business of window frames, i.e., a merchant, and Sam was a commercial builder. Sam was a merchant, because he regularly dealt with and had skills in the area of windows. UCC's merchant-tomerchant rules will apply.<br /><br /><b>b. New terms between merchants.</b> Between merchants, new and additional terms are included in the agreement unless: the offer was expressly conditional upon the offeror's terms, or acceptance was limited to the terms of the acceptance or the offeree objects to the new terms within 10 days.<br /><br /><b>(i) Sam's written note - Time for performance.</b><br /><br /> Here, Sam will argue that his \"must have guarantee - - - within 15 days...\" was a term on which his offer was expressly conditioned, and that therefore Windco's change to \"within 60 days\" is not included. However, Windco will argue that Sam's wording did not say: \"expressly conditional upon\" or \"offer limited to . . .\" & that Sam's words were only a desire, not an express condition. Windco will likely prevail & the term is 60 days for installation.<br /><br /><b>(ii) Shipping charge & parol evidence.</b><br /><br /> Windco will argue that its additional term \"$200 shipping charge\" was included, because Sam didn't object within 10 days. In support, Windco will offer parol evidence of the custom in the industry that shipping is borne by the buyer (here: Sam).<br /><br /> Sam will say that oral evidence of prior or contemporaneous terms are not admissible if the writing was fully integrated. Sam will also argue that the additional $200 is material & onerous & changed the bargain & that therefore the $200 is not included.<br /><br /> Windco will however be able to introduce oral evidence to explain & clarify what the shipping term was intended to be and what is customary in the trade, as such explanatory evidence is not barred by the parol evidence rule. Also, $200 on top of $3,000 total is not a material additional charge, so Windco will likely prevail & the $200 term is included.<br /><br /><b>B. Consideration</b> is the bargained-for exchange of acts or promises incurring a benefit as well as new legal detriment to both parties. Here, Sam obtained goods (benefit) in exchange for having to pay Windco (new detriment). Vice versa for Windco.<br /><br /><b>1. Promissory estoppel.</b> If for any reason an enforceable K is not found, promissory estoppel is a substitute where one party has reasonably relied to his detriment on the other's promise. Here, Windco went ahead with the installation & supplied the frames. Doing so, it detrimentally relied on Sam's promise. <br /><br />Consideration or its substitute existed.<br /><br /><b>C. Defenses to Formation</b><br /><br /><b>1. Statute of Frauds (SOF).</b> SOF requires Ks for goods valued at $500 or more to be in a sufficient writing. Here, the K was for a total of $3,000 and had to be in writing. Since Sam is the one to be charged the $200 in dispute, his signature was required by SOF, but the \"Ack of Order\" was on Windco letterhead.<br /><br /><b>a. Merchant's confirming memo.</b> Where one merchant sends the other a memo confirming an agreement that the other has reason to know of and understand, the memo suffices as a writing under SOF even if not signed by the one to be charged. Here, since the Ack of Order contained subject matter (windows), identity of the parties, price & Windco's signature (or on Windco's letterhead), SOF is satisfied.<br /><br /><b>b. Divisible K.</b> It can also be argued that the contract was a sequence of contracts, each for $100, and that each such K therefore was not within SOF. The $200 would then be for installation services (governed by common law; not UCC) which do not fall within the SOF goods provision. Since the services were to be provided within one year (here: within 60 days), that SOF provision also doesn't require a writing signed by Sam. <br /><br />An enforceable K was formed with terms $200 shipping & installation within 60 days.<br /><br /><b>D. Recovery.</b><br /><br /><b>1. Expectation interest</b>. Windco will recover its expectation interest, i.e., the price it expected to obtain under the contract, which was $3,000 + $200 shipping. Even if the court decides the $200 term was not part of the K, Windco will get $3,000.<br /><br /><b>2. Consequential & Delay damages.</b> If W can show that it suffered damages as a consequence of not receiving Sam's payment on time, it will be awarded also consequential damages, i.e., those amounts reasonably foreseeable to flow from Sam's breach at K formation time. Here, since Sam is refusing only to pay the $200 (not the $3,000), consequentials shouldn't apply.<br /><br /><b>II. Sam v. Windco.</b><br /><br /><b>A. Recovery</b><br /><br /><b>1. Consequentials.</b> If the court finds that the time to performance was within 15 days, then Sam will recover consequentials (defined supra). Delay damages that both parties knew or should have known would result from Windco's failure to install timely would be recoverable.<br /><br /><b>B. Breach of implied warranty.</b><br /><br />Each product put into the stream of commerce carries an implied warranty that the goods are suited for their ordinary use. Here, window frames should be suited for use when it's raining, i.e., not leak[ing].<br /><br /> <b>1. Parties.</b> Plaintiff must be a purchaser or user. Here, Sam was the purchaser of the windows. Defendant must be one generally in the commercial supply chain. Here, Windco was (see supra under merchants). The parties are proper.<br /><br /> <b>2. Merchantable.</b> Defined supra. The product was defective due to a manufacturing defect in that the glass didn't fit properly; thus not fit for ordinary use (not merchantable).<br /><br /> <b>3. Defenses.</b> Windco will assert that it disclaimed all warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. Such a disclaimer is effective if conspicuous, as here printed in bold. Sam will however argue his purpose for entering into the K was to obtain windows that were functional and that Windco will be unjustly enriched if allowed to not compensate him so he can obtain other substitute goods (to \"cover\") & be reimbursed by Windco for his expenses therefor.<br /><br /> <b>4. Perfect tender rule.</b> Under the UCC, where goods are to be delivered in a single delivery, the buyer (here: Sam) has a right to obtain perfectly conforming goods. Even though Sam didn't discover the defect (non-conformity) of the goods until later, he can still reject the lot, accept the lot or any portion thereof, upon timely notice to Windco. If Windco still has time under the contract (5 days left from 55 to 60 days) to perform it has a right to cure by replacing the windows.",
				"<b>WINDCO v. SAM</b><br /><br /> <b>Does the UCC Apply?</b><br /><br /> The UCC applies to all contracts for the sale of goods. Goods are moveable, tangible property.<br /><br /> Here, the subject matter is shown to [be] predominately goods because \"installation comprises 15% of Windco's total price.\"<br /><br /> Therefore, the UCC applies.<br /><br /> <b>Merchants?</b><br /><br /> A merchant is one who regularly deals in goods of this kind or who, by his occupation, has some special skill or knowledge as to this type of goods.<br /><br /> Here, \"Windco manufactures and installs insulated window-frame units\" and Sam, \"a commercial dealer,\" likely has special knowledge of windows.<br /><br /> Therefore, both parties are merchants.<br /><br /> <b>Valid Contract</b><br /><br /> In order to determine if any rights exist we first must determine if there is a valid, enforceable contract. A contract consists of an offer, acceptance, consideration and lack of formation defenses.<br /><br /> <b>Offer</b><br /><br /> An offer is manifestation of present contractual intent, communicated to an identified offeree, containing definite and certain terms.<br /><br /> Here, Windco's ad will be considered only an invitation to accept offers. When Sam mailed this order form he made an offer to Windco, containing terms (30 window frames @$100/frame). A reasonable person would believe Sam made a commitment to enter a contract because of this information.<br /><br /> Therefore, there is a valid offer.<br /><br /> <b>Acceptance and Acceptance With Addition[al] Terms UCC2-207</b><br /><br /> An acceptance is an unequivocal assent to the terms of a[n] offer, unlike common law, where the acceptance must be the \"mirror image.\" The UCC allows additional terms.<br /><br />  At issue here are the terms Sam first added to his offer guaranteeing installation within 15 days. Windco's acknowledgment of order altered this term guaranteeing installation \"within 60 days.\" As between merchants any additional term will become part of the contract unless the contract limits it to its own terms, there is an objection within 10 days, or the term materially alters the contract.<br /><br /> Here, while Sam wanted installation within 15 days, the question arises if this qualifies as a time is of the essence condition. Because Sam did not object upon receiving Windco's acceptance with additional terms, it likely will be held that this is not a material term. And this term will become part of the contract.<br /><br /> Shipping cost language will not be a material term as \"shipping costs are customarily borne by the buyer.\"<br /><br /> Warranty disclaimers are valid if conspicuous and use the term merchantability.<br /><br /> Therefore, unless a court finds the installation date guaranty to be a material term, all of these terms will become part of the contract.<br /><br /> <b>Consideration</b><br /><br /> Consideration is a legally sufficient, bargained-for exchange.<br /><br /> Here, there appear to be no consideration issues as Sam is to pay money, Windco is to provide window frames which neither were legally obligated to do.<br /><br /> <b>Defenses-Statute of Frauds (SOF)</b><br /><br /> Under the statute of frauds certain contracts must be evidenced by a writing to be enforceable. Contracts for goods of $500 or more fall under the statute of frauds.<br /><br /> Such contracts can be taken out of the statute of frauds by performance. Facts here state \"Windco installed the windo[ws].\" Therefore, this contract can be taken out of the SOF.<br /><br /> In any case, because there are documents authenticated by both parties (mail order form by Sam & acknowledgment of order by Windco) that are writings sufficient to bring the contract within the statute of frauds.<br /><br /> Therefore, the statute of frauds will no[t] prevent this contract from being enforceable.<br /><br /> <b>Unconscionability</b><br /><br /> Unconscionability arises if there can be shown both procedural and substantive unconscionability.<br /><br /> Here, Windco's form stated \"contract of sale subject to terms herein.\" Sam may attempt to claim this is substantively unconscionable, however to be procedurally  unconscionable a party must show a lack of bargaining power. Nothing in the facts indicates that Sam could not have purchased window frames elsewhere. Further, to be substantively unconscionable the term must be one-sided. On these facts there is no indication Windco was greatly or significantly in a position to make such a windfall.<br /><br /> Therefore, unconscionability will fail as a defense.<br /><br /> There is a valid enforceable contract.<br /><br /> <b>Terms and Conditions</b><br /><br /> As shown above Windco performed by installing the windows. This condition precedent was fulfilled. It therefore falls upon Sam to meet his obligation or be in breach.<br /><br /> <b>Breach</b><br /><br /> When one does not fulfill their obligation under a contract or excuse a condition they are in breach.<br /><br /> Here, Sam's refusal to pay the $200 shipping fee is a breach. As noted above, this term became part of the contract because as shown by the usage in trade such a cost is \"borne by the buyer.\" Sam must pay the $200.<br /><br /> At issue here is the disclaimer of warranty discussed above. Often disclaimers of warranty can be material. However, as shown above, this disclaimer met the requirement of \"bold & conspicuous\" type and expressly mentioned \"merchantability and fitness.\"<br /><br /> Therefore, Sam will have no claim under either warranty or merchantability claim or a warranty of fitness for a particular purpose. In fact, Sam did not indicate a particular purpose at time of contracting so as to become a basis of the bargain.<br /><br /> <b>Remedies</b><br /><br /> As discussed above, Windco will receive the full contract price plus the $200 shipping fee.<br /><br /> However, if Sam can demonstrate that the late installation did cause the \"several delay-related expenses\" th[at] he claims this will be considered a minor breach (usually timely performance is not a major breach and, as shown above, this contract does not qualify as a \"time is of the essence\" contract).<br /><br /> Therefore, Sam will be able to offset the delay-related costs against the contract price, thus reducing his payment by that amount, because Windco will be found to have substantially performed. The court abhors a waste and will reduce Sam's debt by the difference between what the building now is worth and what it would have been worth if the contract was fulfilled as expected."

Jon told her that he planned to trim 50 pounds from his own considerably hefty frame by participating in the program of diet, exercise and strength training offered at the spa. He wanted to have \"before and after\" pictures taken of himself eating at the spa, working out on the spa exercise equipment and hiking along one of the spa's scenic trails. The photographs were to be displayed in strategic locations throughout the spa and would be included in the spa's brochure. Debbie stated that the total charge for the photography (which would consist of five \"before\" pictures and five \"after\" pictures) would be $1,000. The parties agreed that the \"before\" pictures would be taken on the following day.<br /><br /> When Debbie arrived at the spa, she learned for the first time that it was a health spa for nudists. Debbie was extremely uncomfortable, but the naked Jon persuaded her to stay and take the first set of pictures.<br /><br /> On the next day, Jon received the five \"before\" pictures and a letter from Debbie requesting immediate payment of $500, and stating that the five \"after\" pictures would be taken by her assistant upon notification that Jon had lost 50 pounds.<br /><br /> Jon consults you and asks the following questions:<br /><br /> 1. Does an enforceable contract exist between Debbie and Jon? Discuss.<br /><br /> 2. Assuming that an enforceable contract exists, can Jon require Debbie to take the \"after\" pictures personally? Discuss.<br /><br /> 3. Is Debbie entitled to a $500 payment at this time? Discuss.",

				"<b>Contracts</b><br /><br /> This is a contract primarily for services and will be analyzed using common law principles. Debbie is a photographer and contract is for services - taking the photographs (not for the photos themselves) for common law. UCC rules discussed when they apply only. (Uniform Commercial Code).<br /><br /> <b>I. Don v. Debbie - Enforceable Contract?</b><br /><br /> <b>A. Formation</b><br /><br /> <b>1. Mutual Assent</b><br /><br /> <b>a. Offer</b> must contain subject matter, definite terms, and intention to be bound. Here, Jon called Debbie and discussed the 10 photos and their purpose, the terms, and expressed intention to be bound. Offer is valid.<br /><br /> <b>b. Acceptance.</b> Must be a mirror image agreement to the offer and express the intention to be bound. Here, Debbie accepts Jon's offer, and both agree to the specific terms.<br /><br /> <b>c. Consideration.</b> Is a bargained for exchange of legal detriment. Here, Debbie agrees to take pictures in exchange for Jon's payment of money. Consideration is adequate.<br /><br /> <b>II. Defenses</b><br /><br /> A. Statute of Frauds - (SOF) valuable and easily misunderstood contracts must be in writing.<br /><br /> <b>1) UCC $500 Rule</b> - In order for the contract to be enforceable, it must be in writing if the value of the goods is more than $500 (valuable). Here, under UCC, a writing is necessary. But because this contract is primarily a services contract, it would be enforceable without a writing.<br /><br /> <b>a. One year rule</b> - Both UCC and Non-UCC. If a contract, at time at formation, cannot be performed within one year, a writing is necessary for the contract to be enforceable. Here, (hopefully) Jon can lose 50# in less than one year, and this rule does not apply. The contract is valid without a written contract.<br /><br /> <b>b. Impossibility/Impracticability</b> If there are intervening events that occur which are unforeseeable, the performance is excused (leg. [sic] illegality destruction of subject matter, death/incapacity of the parties).<br /><br /> Here, Debbie became uncomfortable when she found out that Jon's spa was a nudist camp. She would try to assert that being uncomfortable once was enough; the second time was impossible for her.<br /><br /> <b>c. Mistake</b><br /><br /> When a Debbie did not know that a Jon's spa was a nudist camp, Jon did not tell her that it was a nudist camp, and an either party knew (at formation) that Debbie was not comfortable in the nudist camp, there was a mutual mistake. The contract is voidable by either party.<br /><br /> Unilateral mistake - If Jon could argue that Debbie should have known or asked about certain circumstances that precluded her work, he can prevail on this issue.<br /><br /> If Debbie can show that Jon should have told her that his spa was a nudist camp, Debbie would prevail. The mistake is chargeable to the more unreasonable party.<br /><br /> <b>d. Detrimental Reliance</b> - Promissory Estoppel Partial performance - Jon would argue that there was a partial performance by Debbie and that he relied reasonably and detrimentally that Debbie would finish the job.<br /><br /> <b>e. Modification</b><br /><br /> At common law, modification requires additional consideration. At UCC, only good faith is necessary. Consideration substitutes can be used, e.g. detrimental reliance, supra. Here, Debbie wishes to modify contract from $1,000 for 10 photos to $500 for 5 photos. She can prevail at common law if she can show additional consideration, or, at UCC, good faith. But Jon has no consideration. This modification is not valid.<br /><br /> <b>III. Can Jon require Debbie to take \"after\" pictures?</b><br /><br /> <b>A. Delegation of Duty</b> - Courts favor assignment and delegation. The delegation must be with the consent of the obligee or must not be to his detriment. Here, if Jon does not want to give consent for delegation of duty to Debbie's assistant, he must show that there is diminution in value of the services.<br /><br /> <b>B. Personal Services</b> - Contracts are not assignable. If Jon can assert that Debbie's services were so personal that her duties cannot be delegated, he would prevail. Debbie would argue that photography is not like a portrait and that an equally qualified photographer (such as her assistant) could perform just as well. However, courts are reluctant to enforce specific performance on personal service contracts. Damages would likely be in expectation damages.<br /><br /> <b>IV. Is Debbie entitled to a $500 payment at this time?</b><br /><br /> <b>A. Express v. Constructive Conditions</b><br /><br /> All express conditions must be completely performed to avoid breach. Constructive conditions must be substantially performed to avoid breach. Here, the question would be whether there was an express (v. constructive) condition that the total job would need to be completed before payment in order to avoid breach. The courts won't likely construe this to mean the entire contract. <b>B. Divisible Contract?</b><br /><br /> If Debbie can successfully argue that the contract consisted of 2 parts (before and after) she would be entitled to partial payment for partial performance. This is not a divisible contract and Jon would prevail. <b>C. Modification valid?</b><br /><br /> No, for inadequate consideration, supra.<br /><br /> <b>D. Quasi - Contract Recovery</b><br /><br /> In order to avoid unjust enrichment the court considers recovery in Quasi-Contracts. Traditionally, only the non-breaching party could recover. In modern law, the breaching party could also recover if the breach were not willful and in good faith. Here, Debbie would be able to recover $500 for value of the before photographs, because her breach was in good faith.<br /><br /> <b>V. Damages under UCC</b><br /><br /> <b>1. Seller's breach</b> - When seller breaches, the buyer is entitled to market price minus contract price. Alternatively, buyer can \"cover.\" A buyer is entitled to seek replacement from another buyer and sue the seller for the difference.",
				"<b>Enforceable Contract Between Debbie and Jon?</b><br /><br /> Since this is not a contract for goods common law will be the authority.<br /><br /> <b>1. Contract?</b><br /><br /> A contract is a promise or set of promises the performance of which the law recognizes as a duty and the breach of which the law will provide a remedy [sic]. It consists of mutual assent and [is] supported by consideration.<br /><br /> <b>2. Was There an Offer by Debbie?</b><br /><br /> An offer is a manifestation of present contractual intent communicated to the offeree such that a reasonable person would conclude that a bargain had been formed. Under common law an offer must include: parties, subject matter, price, and time and quantity. Here the parties are implied because she is \"stating\" this to Jon.<br /><br /> The quantity is stated as \"5 before pic[ture]s and 5 after\" pictures.<br /><br /> The price is \"$1,000 dollars and the time is the next day\".<br /><br /> Therefore there is a valid offer here.<br /><br /> <b>3. Acceptance?</b><br /><br /> An acceptance is an affirmative assent communicated to the offeror in the manner requested, if not requested then in a reasonable manner. An acceptance to a bilateral offer may be by return promise or by performance.<br /><br /> Here there is an acceptance because \"the parties agreed\" that the before pictures would be taken the following day. Therefore Jon assented to the onset of Debbie's performance.<br /><br /> <b>4. Consideration?</b><br /><br /> Is a bargained-for exchange that causes legal detriment. Here there is consideration because Debbie is promising to take photographs (using her professional skills and time) and Jon is promising to pay Debbie $1,000.<br /><br /> <b>5. Statute of Frauds?</b><br /><br /> The statute requires that certain contracts be reduced to writing to be enforceable. One of these is for goods $500 and over. Although this seems like a contract for Debbie's services as a photographer, she is also producing tangible moveable goods. The goods were not moveable at the time the contract was formed, however, and therefore the statute would not apply. Therefore a contract exists and it is enforceable.<br /><br /> <b>Jon v. Debbie</b><br /><br /> <b>Contract?</b> Assuming a contract exists, supra, what are the rights Jon may assert?<br /><br /> Was there an enforceable delegation from Debbie to assistant?<br /><br /> The law favors delegations. A delegation occurs when one party delegates his duties under an existing contract to a third party.<br /><br /> Here there is a delegation because Debbie says \"the after pictures would be taken by the assistant.\"<br /><br /> Is the delegation binding on the assistant? A delegation is binding on the delegatee only if they knowingly consent; usually consideration is involved. There are no facts stating whether the assistant consented. One could reasonably assume she was being compensated and consideration would exist.<br /><br /> Debbie would remain liable for performance as the delegator.<br /><br /> Are there exceptions to an enforceable delegation?<br /><br /> <b>Exceptions</b> -<br /><br /> 1. Prohibited by contract;<br /><br /> 2. Prohibited by statute;<br /><br /> 3. Too personal in nature.<br /><br /> Here there may be a valid exception because it could be argued that the artistry of a \"well known photographer\" is too personal in nature to delegate.<br /><br /> Therefore Debbie would not be able to delegate her services.<br /><br /> Can Jon demand that Debbie take the pictures?<br /><br /> Where specific performance would require one to personally perform it will not be enforced based on a prohibition on involuntary servitude.<br /><br /> Therefore Debbie would not be forced to perform. She may, however, be enjoined from performing elsewhere during that time.<br /><br /> Her discomfort may be a factor to rebut based on impracticability.<br /><br /> <b>Debbie v. Jon</b><br /><br /> If Debbie doesn't perform is she entitled to partial compensation?<br /><br /> If Debbie's \"extreme discomfort\" can be shown to make performance impracticable she may be entitled to services already rendered.<br /><br /> <b>Impracticability</b> exists where a reasonably unforeseeable intervening event, the risk of which was not assumed by either party, makes performance extremely difficult; the duties of the parties may be discharged. Here may be reasonably unforeseeable because \"it was a nudist camp and Debbie didn't find out about it until that day. There is no indication she assumed this risk. In order to be successful, she would have to [show] that it would be very difficult to perform the contract. Since \"Jon persuaded her to stay\" the first time, it may be difficult.<br /><br /> She may be able to recover <b>quantum meruit</b> for the services already provided.<br /><br /> She may argue that there was a divisible contract and recover under this theory. \"Jon received the 5 before pictures\" and Debbie's demand for payment. There is nothing in the contract telling us there is a separate delivery for a separate payment."

You will be paid $5.00 per year.\" Pam e-mailed back, stating, \"That's right, Dad; the garage is clean and ready for storage.\"<br /><br /> Ted also sent an e-mail to Dave, a customer of Chip Co, which stated, \"We agree to replace our defective chip in your computer, but only if you agree not to bring any legal action against Chip Co.\" Dave sent a return e-mail stating that he agreed to these terms.<br /><br /> Ted telephoned Bob, another customer of Chip Co, to confirm that Chip Co will send 100 computer chip units to Bob, who had already fully paid for the units, but only if Bob agreed to pay an additional 10% due to an increase in Chip Co's operating costs. Bob reluctantly agreed, as he needed the chips immediately.<br /><br /> Ted wrote a letter to Silicon Inc., in which Chip Co offered to buy 10 tons of processed silicon during the coming year, at market price, should Chip Co need any silicon. Silicon Inc. responded, agreeing to sell all the silicon to Chip Co that it might want.<br /><br /> Is there adequate consideration for Chip Co's agreements above-described with Pam, Dave, Bob and Silicon, Inc.? Discuss.",

				"<b>PAM v. TED</b><br /><br /> <b>Governing Law</b><br /><br /> The governing law in this case is the common law, because the transaction involves a lease of land.<br /><br /> <b>Was there a Contract?</b><br /><br /> A valid contract consists of a valid offer, acceptance, bargained-for consideration for which the law recognizes a duty and provides a remedy for breach.<br /><br /> Here, there appears to be an offer, because Ted sent an e-mail to Pam to confirm the terms of there [sic] offer. Pam's response, \"That's right,\" appears to be an acceptance of the terms of the e-mail and confirmation of the offer. Further, the confirmation contained sufficient definite terms to clearly state the terms of the agreement.<br /><br /> Therefore, a valid contract exists.<br /><br /> <b>Consideration</b><br /><br /> Valid consideration consists of a bargained-for exchange between the parties. It consist[sic] of a legal detriment to the promisee (Pam), which is bargain for by the promisor (Ted). Generally, the court will not inquiry [sic] where the consideration appears to be minimal (nominal) or clearly one-sided. Further, consideration can consist of monetary value of forbearance of doing something that one has the legal right to do.<br /><br /> Here, although the facts don't state the size of the garage, the consideration of $5.00 appears to be minimal or nominal given the average size of a garage. Despite this, $5.00 per year is very minimal and questions as to the adequacy of consideration paid. However, Ted could argue the fact that Chip Co (\"Chip\") is a small company and part of the bargained-for exchange was Pam's interest in the success of Chip.<br /><br /> Therefore, adequate consideration can be found.<br /><br /> <b>Defenses</b><br /><br /> <b>The statute of frauds</b> (\"SOF\") requires that a contract for an interest in land, including leases, be in w[r]iting. Further, any contract for which performance is impossible within one year is required to be in witting[sic].<br /><br /> Here, Pam could argue that there was not a witting[sic] that was signed by Ted, the party to be charged. Ted would argue that the e-mail was sent via the company e-mail and constitute[s] a sufficient witting[sic] to document the agreement and had sufficient terms to indicate the agreement. Because the e-mail contains an ability to verify that the e-mail was sent and provides evidence of the terms of the agreement, the court is likely to find that the e-mail was a sufficient witting[sic] to comply with the witting[sic] requirement of the SOF.<br /><br /> Therefore, this defense would not work.<br /><br /> <b>DAVE v. TED</b><br /><br /> <b>Governing law</b><br /><br /> Here, the UCC is the governing law, as the transaction involves the sale of goods. Merchants<br /><br /> A merchant is a person who deals in the type of goods involved in the transaction or holds themselves out as having special knowledge in the goods. Here, Ted is clearly a merchant, as he deals in the type of goods involved (chips).<br /><br /> <b>Contract</b><br /><br /> See definition above.<br /><br /> Here, an offer was clearly made because the e-mail sent by Ted to Dave indicated Ted's willingness to enter into an agreement. Such offer was clearly accepted by Dave via Dave's e-mail back to Ted.<br /><br /> Therefore, a contract was formed.<br /><br /> <b>Consideration</b><br /><br /> See definition above.<br /><br /> Here, Ted is bargaining for Dave's agreement to not \"bring any legal action\". The courts will not normally inquire as to the adequacy of such agreement absent Ted's knowledge that the claim was false. If the claim was false and Ted or Dave knew the claims was [sic] false, then such agreement to not bring any legal action would not be bargained for or represent legal detriment. Although the facts don't state that the claim was valid, if it is found that the claim was valid, then adequate consideration was provided. However, see preexisting duty below.<br /><br /> Therefore, the court will find adequate consideration if the claim is valid and was bargained for in exchange for not bringing any legal action.<br /><br /> <b>Preexisting Duty</b><br /><br /> A preexisting duty is a duty for which one is already legal[sic] required to do. Under the common law, any modification requires consideration. If no consideration is found, the court would likely find that such modification was not bargained for. However, the UCC allows modification without consideration, as long as the modification was made in good faith.<br /><br /> Here, Dave would argue that Ted was under a preexisting duty to replace the defective chips, because this a[sic] warranty issue. However, the facts don't indicate that Ted had given a warranty for the chips. Further, if such warranty had been disclaimed, not[sic] duty to fix the chips would exists[sic]. Absent these facts, there does not appear to be any requirement for Ted to fix the chips.<br /><br /> Therefore, since the facts don't indicate that a warranty existed, Ted and Dave's agreement would appear to be a valid bargain-for exchange.<br /><br /> <b>BOB v. TED</b><br /><br /> <b>Governing Law</b><br /><br /> UCC would govern (see above).<br /><br /> <b>Merchant</b><br /><br /> See above. It appears that Bob is a merchant as well, because Bob is a customer and presumably the chips would be utilized in a product, especially given that the average consumer doesn't usually purchase 100 computer chips for personal use.<br /><br /> <b>Contract</b><br /><br /> See definition above.<br /><br /> Here, Ted telephoned to confirm what appears to already have been an agreement to send 100 chips. This is supported by the fact that Bob had fully paid.<br /><br /> <b>Modification</b><br /><br /> As discussed above, merchants can modify an agreement absent consideration as long as 1) the parties agree and 2) the modification was made in good faith.<br /><br /> Here, Ted's communication to Bob appeared to be a refusal to ship unless Bob agreed to the price increase. Although the facts state that Bob reluctantly agreed, the facts don't appear to indicate that the price increase was made in bad faith, because the facts show that the market price had increased. Bob would argue that this was in bad faith, because an increase in the market price was why Bob had entered into the agreement to protect from price. Bob could have rejected the increase and sued for damages, but didn't.<br /><br /> Therefore, absent any evidence of bad faith on the part of Ted, valid consideration was obtained.<br /><br /> <b>State of Frauds (\"SOF\")</b><br /><br /> Sale of goods greater than $500 are required to be in witting[sic]. This includes modifications.<br /><br /> Here, Ted telephone[sic] Bob and modified the agreement, which Bob accepted. The facts don't support that a writing was obtained. As such, Bob could argue that the agreement was not valid because the modification was required to be in witting[sic] given that it involved the sale of goods. However, the facts don't state the price and is[sic] would have to be shown that the 10% increase was greater than $500.<br /><br /> Therefore, if the modification was greater than $500, the[sic] Bob would be successful in claiming the SOF.<br /><br /> <b>SILICON INC. (\"Silicon\") v. TED</b><br /><br /> <b>Governing Law</b><br /><br /> UCC is the governing law.<br /><br /> <b>Merchant</b><br /><br /> See above. Silicon appears to be a merchant as well, because they deal in the goods involved.<br /><br /> <b>Offer and Acceptance</b><br /><br /> See definition above.<br /><br /> Here, there is an offer made by Ted, which appears to have been accepted by Silicon.<br /><br /> <b>Consideration</b><br /><br /> See definition above. If a promise doesn't really bind someone to perform, but states that such party can perform if they want, then such promise is considered to be illusory.<br /><br /> Here, because Silicon's response Ted's[sic] offer to purchase 10 tons of silicon stated that they agreed to sell all the silicon to Chip Co that it might want appears to be illusory because it really doesn't bind Chip to purchase all of their requirements form[sic] Silicon. Ted's offer clearly manifests an intent to purchased[sic] 10 tons of silicon, at market price, should Chip need any silicon. Because Ted could but[sic] the silicon should it need to, it didn't bind Chip to purchase such amount.<br /><br /> Therefore, no valid bargained-for consideration was given.<br /><br /> <b>Promissory estoppel</b><br /><br /> Promissory estoppel will supply consideration up to the point to prevent an injustice if the promisor (Ted) should have known or knew that Silicon would rely on Ted's promise and did actually justifiably rely on Ted's promise.<br /><br /> Here, the facts don't support that Silicon relied on Ted's promise (i.e., hire additional workers). All the facts state is Silicon's response to sell the silicon.<br /><br /> Therefore, absent any evidence of detrimental reliance, promissory estoppel will not apply.",
				"<b>Is there adequate consideration to support the ChipCo - Pam agreement?</b><br /><br /> This agreement contemplates the rendering of a service (storage) and will therefore be governed by the general principals[sic] of contract law.<br /><br /> Here, the parties have exchanged promises. Pam has agreed to provide her garage for use as a storage facility. Since Pam was under no obligation to provide has[sic] garage to ChipCo before the agreement was made, her promise is adequate consideration to support the agreement.<br /><br /> ChipCo has promised to pay Pam %[sic]5.00 dollars a year in exchange for the use of her garage. ChipCo was formally under no obligation to pay Pam $5. so this would appear to also be good consideration for the promise.<br /><br /> In this case, the dollar amount of the payment in[sic] nominal. Generally, the court will not weight[sic] the economic advantages of the consideration, so long as it was fairly bargained for. However, where the consideration is of such little value and where it appears that the consideration was merely recited, the court may find the consideration inadequate.<br /><br /> Here, parties appear to have merely recited a sham consideration in order to make the appearance for a bargained-for exchange as opposed to a gratuitous offer.<br /><br /> If Pam wished to avoid the obligation she could proceed under two theories. First, assuming that the $5. was never in fact paid, she could assert failure of consideration. Second, she could argue that the consideration was nominal and not truly bargained for. The fact that she and Ted (acting as an agent for ChipCo) are closely related tends to show that the offer was gratuitous in nature. However, storage space seems to be an odd gift to give, which would support the contention that the agreement was for a strictly business purpose.<br /><br /> <b>Conclusion</b><br /><br /> If Pam wishes to avoid obligation she would probably prevail by pleading that the $5. was merely a recitation of sham consideration and that therefore her promise is unsupported and not binding.<br /><br /> <b>Consideration for the ChipCo - Dave agreement</b><br /><br /> The subject matter of this agreement is a good; defined as anything mov[e]able at the time of identification to the contract, including crops and timber to be severed from the land and the unborn young of animals. A computer is a good.<br /><br /> The repair of goods is a service and not covered by the UCC. This transaction, however, arises from the sale of the computer. As the original seller of the good, ChipCo remains liable to the buyer for its defective product. Therefore, the contract which this agreement flowed from is to be analysed in light of the UCC.<br /><br /> <b>Relinquishment of a right as consideration</b><br /><br /> Not doing something which one has a legal right to do before the agreement is consideration. Here, Dave gave up the right to bring a legal action against ChipCo. The facts tell us that the product sold to Dave contained a defect. While we do not have any express warranty to look at, all goods sold by merchant sellers come with an implied warranty of merchantability.<br /><br /> In this case, the computer contained a defect. The implied warranty would cover a properly working computer, fit for its intended purpose. Since the computer was not fit for its intended purpose, Dave had a cause of action against ChipCo for breach of the implied warranty of merchantability. Relinquishment of that right is valuable consideration.<br /><br /> <b>Preexisting duty</b><br /><br /> On the other hand, ChipCo was under an already existing duty to repair the computer or to respond with money damages in a breach of contract action. Some courts have found that relinquishing the right to respond in breach is consideration; no facts here would make a good argument for that. The efficiency of responding with money damages rather than repairing or replacing the product is not evident. Furthermore, the UCC favors the out-ofcourt resolution which would be for ChipCo to repair its product.<br /><br /> Therefore, ChipCo promise[sic] to repair the chip will not be found to provide adequate consideration as ChipCo was under a preexisting duty to do so.<br /><br /> <b>Good faith modification under the UCC</b><br /><br /> While at common law, any agreement to modify an existing contracts[sic] had to be supported by new consideration; the UCC allows a modification without new consideration, if made in good faith.<br /><br /> Here, the good faith of ChipCo is questionable. ChipCo seems to have strong-armed a valuable right from Dave, in exchange for only doing what they were obligated to do anyway.<br /><br /> It is unlikely that a reviewing court would find this modification agreement in good faith, even in the face of Dave's agreement to it. Therefore, the agreement will be unenforceable.<br /><br /> <b>Is there adequate consideration for the Bob - ChipCo agreement?</b><br /><br /> In this case we have bilateral executory contract, fully performed on Bob's side. His contract obligations have been fully discharged by his payment. Furthermore, his agreement to pay, and then paying, for computer chip units is good consideration, as he was obligated to buy them beforehand.<br /><br /> Additionally, ChipCo's agreement to sell the chips is good consideration for the agreement. At issue here, again, is the subsequent modification of the existing enforceable contract.<br /><br /> <b>Good Faith</b> As discussed above, the UCC allows a good faith modification of a contract without new consideration. However, both parties must agree to the change in terms.<br /><br /> Here, we have ChipCo making a demand for more money. Bob was under no obligation to agree to pay the additional money. The resolution of this question will therefore turn on Bob's response. Had he made an unqualified agreement, and had ChipCo made the demand in good faith, then the modification would be enforceable.<br /><br /> However, we are told that Bob \"reluctantly agreed\" because he needed the chips immediately. This would tend to show that Bob did not intend to modify the contract but only intended to receive the benefit of his original bargain.<br /><br /> Therefore, Bob can assert a lack of good faith in modification and it will not be enforceable against him.<br /><br /> <b>Is there adequate consideration for ChipCo's agreement with Silicon?</b><br /><br /> In this case we have what appears to be an illusory promise. ChipCo has offered to buy silicon \"should\" it need any and Silicon has agreed to sell all the silicon ChipCo \"might want\". At first blush, ChipCo does not appear to be obligated to any greater extent than it was before the promise was made.<br /><br /> <b>Requirements Contracts</b><br /><br /> Under the UCC, as well as at common law (Wood v. Lucy), business contracts such as this have implied good faith or best efforts. Requirements contracts are not illusory because the law regards them as being for \"as required in good faith\".<br /><br /> Here, ChipCo is not obligated to buy anything from Ted. However, if ChipCo comes to require silicone, a very likely event, it will be obligated to buy from Ted.<br /><br /> Therefore, there is sufficient consideration to support ChipCo's promise with the addition of the good faith term."

He telephoned Rita, and when she answered the phone, Marvin said, \"I accept your offer to paint my home for $2,000. Please start as soon as possible.\" Before Rita could say a word, Marvin blurted out his home address and abruptly hung up.<br /><br /> Sue also telephoned Rita and asked about having her garage painted. Rita informed Sue that she would have to come to Sue's home before providing a bid, and the two got together at Sue's home later that day. After looking over the garage and negotiating the particulars of the paint job, Rita told Sue that she would paint the garage for $700. Sue responded that $700 was a \"pretty good price,\" but that she wished Rita would do the job for less and needed to consider her options. The following morning, Sue left a phone message on Rita's answering machine saying that she had decided to accept Rita's offer.<br /><br /> Rita also received a recorded phone message from Mary, another possible new client, stating, \"I saw your flyer in the grocery store. If you can paint my house for $2,000, the job is yours.\" The message provided Mary's address. After Rita drove past Mary's house to look at the prospective job, she decided to paint Mary's house. The next day Rita went to Mary's home, with all the necessary painting supplies, but when she started working on Mary's home, Mary came running outside and told Rita to stop painting the house, as she had found a different painting contractor for the job.<br /><br /> Does Rita have enforceable contracts with either Marvin, Sue, or Mary?

			"essay": "Paintco intended to place a bid on the painting work for a large government project, the deadline for which was April 16. Paintco's president published an advertisement in a local trade paper asking paint suppliers to place bids with Paintco for the furnishing of 10,000 gallons of special paint in accordance with the government's specifications. The advertisement, published March 1, stated that Paintco was going to bid on the government job, and asked all interested parties to submit their bids, in writing, on or before April 15, specifying that the bids were to be \"irrevocable for 30 days.\"<br /><br /> On the evening of April 15, Ritzcorp's president telephoned Paintco and submitted Ritzcorp's bid orally by leaving a message on Paintco's answering machine, which was equipped with a voice-decoding feature that translated telephone messages into a written printout. The telephone message, which Paintco's president both heard and read that evening, identified the speaker as Ritzcorp's president and stated that his company would supply 8,500 gallons of paint to Paintco at a price of $10 per gallon. The telephone message also stated that the bid price did not include the cost of delivery, that any acceptance of Ritzcorp's bid must be in writing and must be received by Ritzcorp on or before May 1.<br /><br /> Because Ritzcorp's bid was the lowest, Paintco used it to compute the price of its own irrevocable bid to the government the next day. On May 1, Paintco was notified that it had won the government contract. The same day it mailed a letter to Ritzcorp stating: \"We accept your offer of April 15, but ask that the paint be fully warranted as to quality and that you arrange for delivery of 10,000 gallons of the paint to the job site.\" The letter arrived at Ritzcorp's offices on May 2. Ritzcorp dispatched an e-mail to Paintco that very afternoon, stating that in light of an unexpected rise in the cost of ingredients it was only prepared to offer a price per gallon of $12, and that any paint Paintco chose to purchase would be sold \"as is,\" without any warranties. After subsequent talks between the parties failed to resolve their differences, Paintco promptly secured a commitment from the next lowest bidder, BrushCorp, to supply all 10,000 gallons at a price of $14 per gallon. Paintco then immediately wrote a letter to Ritzcorp declaring that Ritzcorp had repudiated its contractual commitment to supply paint, and threatening to hold it accountable for all damages. Paintco completed the government job using the paint supplied by BrushCorp.<br /><br /> What action(s) can Paintco reasonably assert against Ritzcorp, and what would be the likely result of these action(s)?

All modifications to this contract must be in writing to be enforceable.\"<br /><br /> When the Bears team manager subsequently placed the baseball cap order with CapCo, he informed CapCo that fewer kids had signed up than had been expected, and, consequently, the Bears needed only 50 caps. CapCo responded that such small orders generated less profit and would accordingly trigger a higher price of $8.50 per cap. The Bears team manager orally agreed to that higher price.<br /><br /> CapCo also contacted the Lions, whose team manager was considering several baseball cap suppliers. CapCo sent the Lions manager a letter that stated: \"I can offer you a special deal for a limited time.

Abby made a $500,000 payment to Paula at the time of the sale and agreed to make the final payment of $1 million in six months.<br /><br /> Just prior to the date the final payment was due, Abby sold her business, including the press, to Bert. As part of the sale, Bert agreed with Abby to pay Paula the $1 million due her. Abby represented in the purchase agreement between Abby and Bert that all of the business equipment was in working order, although she knew that the press never functioned as it was intended to. In fact, Abby had previously requested of Paula that she repair or replace the press, but Paula had refused to do so.<br /><br /> After Bert bought the business he discovered the problem with the press. He told Paula that he would not pay her the $1 million due until she repaired or replaced the press. Paula immediately filed a breach of contract lawsuit against Bert for the outstanding $1 million balance. Bert denies any obligation to pay Paula the $1 million on the basis that he had never entered into any contract with Paula.<br /><br /> In addition, Bert asserts two other defenses: First, that the printing press is defective and unsuitable for its intended purpose. Second, that Abby materially misrepresented the condition of the press.<br /><br /> 1. Under what theory or theories may Paula be successful in her breach of contract action against Bert? Discuss.<br /><br /> 2. What is the likelihood that the additional defenses asserted by Bert will prevail? Discuss.",

On Selma's adjoining east lot were a large billboard that would obscure the view of Barnaby's carpet store, a partially-collapsed, abandoned greenhouse, and several abandoned cars and old tires.<br /><br /> After Selma and Barnaby agreed on a price for the west lot, they signed a valid standard real estate sales contract. In a blank space at the end of the contract under the caption, \"Other Terms,\" were the handwritten words, \"Selma to clear debris from adjoining east lot.\" The standard contract also contained a clause, \"This contract represents the entire agreement of the parties. There are no additional representations, promises or conditions precedent to the effectiveness of this agreement.\" According to Barnaby, Selma had promised during their negotiations that she would remove the billboard, the greenhouse, the cars and the tires from the adjoining east lot if Barnaby agreed to purchase the west lot.<br /><br /> By the date for the closing of the sale, Selma had not yet done any work on the adjoining east lot, although she told Barnaby that she fully intended to do everything she had promised. The parties exchanged the purchase price and a deed to the west lot. The following week, Selma had the abandoned cars and old tires removed from the adjoining east lot. When Barnaby asked her about the removal of the billboard and the greenhouse, Selma denied having made any commitment to remove the billboard, which she said brings in substantial rental income from advertisers. She also denied promising to remove the greenhouse, which she indicated she hoped to repair and reopen some day.<br /><br /> Barnaby wants to keep the purchased lot and has already started construction of the carpet store. He would, however, like to obtain a court order directing Selma to remove the billboard and greenhouse and/or to collect monetary damages from her for breach of contract.<br /><br /> 1. Is Barnaby likely to prevail in a breach of contract action against Selma? Discuss.<br /><br /> 2. If Barnaby does prevail against Selma, is he entitled to specific performance and/or monetary damages? Discuss.",

Delta immediately removed its old printing presses and placed two of the new presses into operation. Delta stored the third new press in its original unopened carton. One week after delivery, Delta's Vice President for Operations, Vanessa, notified Press's Sales Manager, Sally, that it wanted to return the third press. Sally asked why it wanted to return the press, and Vanessa responded, \"Delta doesn't need a third press at this time.\" Sally replied that all sales were final and that Delta was obligated to pay for all three presses. Vanessa said that Delta did not want the third press and expected Press to pick it up immediately. Sally responded that she would have a truck pick up the third press the next day, but that Delta was expected to pay for all three presses.<br /><br /> The next day, Press picked up the third press.

When Betsy returned home, she checked prices on the internet for comparable boats and decided the price quoted by Luxe for the Wind Catcher was a good deal.

The contract called for work to begin on June 1 and to be completed on July 1.<br /><br /> Painter was ready to start work on June 1, but Developer told Painter that because of problems with the drywall contractor, Painter could not start work until June 15. To avoid the possibility of losing her employees, who might quit if forced to take a two-week layoff, Painter took another job, which was not completed until June 20, at which time Painter started work on Developer's building.<br /><br /> On July 15, Painter informed Developer that she would not be able to complete the project until August 15. Developer told her he would lose substantial rental income if the project was not completed by August 1, when university students, his prime market, began moving in. He asked her to hire additional help, but she refused, saying the job would be finished on August 15 or not at all. In an attempt to get the job completed sooner, Developer fired Painter and looked for another painting contractor.<br /><br /> The best price Developer could get to have another painting contractor finish the job was $30,000. Before firing Painter, Developer had paid Painter one-half of the contract price. Because the painting was completed late, Developer lost $10,000 in rental income. This rental income would not have been lost if the painting had been completed by August 1.<br /><br /> At the time Painter was fired, she was out-of-pocket for $5,000 in materials. She expected a profit of $5,000 had she been allowed to complete the contract.<br /><br /> Developer has sued Painter for breach of contract. Painter cross-complained against Developer for breach of contract.<br /><br /> 1. Who breached the contract? Discuss.<br /><br /> 2. Assuming Painter breached the contract, what damages, if any, would Developer be entitled to? Discuss.<br /><br /> 3.

			"essay": "Jack, a retiree, plans to build a new home on his vacant property. He decided to use a particular product called \"Austin Brown Stone\" for the exterior walls, and estimated he would need about 100 tons of stone.<br /><br /> Jack drafted a contract to present to Stone-Co, a local stone distributor, in which Jack agreed: (i) to buy all the Austin Brown Stone he needs to build the exterior walls of his house, (ii) at a price of $200 per ton, (iii) to be delivered to his property in 5-ton lots within 10 days following each request for 5 tons, (iv) to be paid for upon delivery. To ensure timely deliveries, Jack included a liquidated damages clause which provided that Stone-Co would pay $5,000 per day for each day that any requested delivery is late.<br /><br /> Jack signed and dropped off the contract to Stone-Co for its review and signature. That evening, the Stone-Co salesperson, knowing that Austin Brown Stone is often not easily obtained, wrote the following just below Jack's liquidated damages clause: \"Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Stone-Co has difficulty getting Austin Brown Stone, Stone-Co may substitute Austin White Stone.\"<br /><br /> The Stone-Co salesperson then signed the contract and returned it to Jack the next day. Jack did not read the modified contract or see the term added by Stone-Co.<br /><br /> One week later, Jack made a request for the first 5 tons of Austin Brown Stone, and Stone-Co started looking for a supplier. Stone-Co quickly discovered that Austin Brown Stone was not available in the United States. Although it could be imported from Canada, importing it would add $25 per ton to Stone-Co's expenses and reduce its profit margin.<br /><br /> Ten days after Jack's order, Stone-Co delivered Austin White Stone with a note stating that Austin Brown Stone was not available in the U.S., and a demand for payment at the new price of $225 per ton. Jack immediately called the Stone-Co salesperson, stating he would not accept the substitution because Austin White Stone is a completely different product.<br /><br /> Jack contracted with another supplier for Austin Brown Stone at $225 per ton. Jack thereafter filed a lawsuit against Stone-Co seeking damages for breach of contract and liquidated damages. <br /><br />1. What is Jack's likelihood of success in his lawsuit and what damages, if any, would he be entitled to? Discuss.<br /><br /> 2. What defenses, if any, can Stone-Co reasonably assert? Discuss.",

She is a recognized expert in the 1939-50 era.<br /><br /> Bill operates a store that regularly sells baseball cards. Bill claims he phoned Sara and offered to buy a 1939 Denny Wilson card for $550, and that Sara accepted.<br /><br /> Immediately after their phone conversation, Bill sent Sara an unsigned, typed letter confirming the contract, and identifying the parties, the Denny Wilson card and the price. Bill's letter had a letterhead identifying the name of his business, Beyer's Baseball Cards and Collectibles.

Sara's card was not certified, and the parties had not discussed this before.<br /><br /> Sara received and read the letter but did not respond to it. When Bill called later, Sara said she had sold the card to another party for $575. Bill sued Sara for breach of contract, seeking $250 in damages (based on $800 as the fair market value of a certified card).<br /><br /> Sara denies the existence of a contract, alleging that Bill only asked, \"Would you consider taking $550\" for the card, and that she replied, \"Okay, send me something in writing.\" Alternatively, she claims that the phone agreement was unenforceable and that the so-called letter of confirmation had no legal effect.

In this case, O was contracted to pay C $35,000, but this price included the use of 2 parking spaces by C. The original contract was going to cost O $50,000. O was scheduled to receive the installation of the unit. The court cannot fully compensate C through expectation damages because C was expecting an installation, and the court will not require specific performance on a personal service contract.<br /><br /> <b>Cover.</b><br /><br /> The court will allow O to \"cover\" his damages by contracting with someone else to provide what C was not able to. Thus, O will be able to recover the difference between the cost of his new contract and the cost of his original contract. The court will likely estimate this against the $50,000 figure which was originally agreed to, because the $35,000 figure included the use of two parking spaces.<br /><br /> O will likely be able to recover the $10,000 extra that was spent under the new contract.<br /><br /> <b>Duty to mitigate</b><br /><br /> O has the duty to mitigate his damages to prevent any unreasonable and foreseeable increase in damages which could have been avoided. The facts are not clear as to whether or not O tried to find cheaper contractors before agreeing to the price of $60,000. However, considering that O was trying hard to get the work done quickly presumably he contacted multiple contractors and picked the one that was the best balance of price and timeliness.<br /><br /> If O failed to mitigate then C would be able to reduce the damages by the amount which O could reasonably have avoided.",
						"COMPENSATORY DAMAGES<br /><br /> EXPECTATION DAMAGES<br /><br /> Expectation damages are damages to provide the non-breaching party with the exchange bargained for. Under Hadley-Baxendale, damages must be contemplated by the parties at the time of contract formation.<br /><br /> COVER PRICE<br /><br /> Here, the Owner bargained for a fully functional solar heating system for the price of $50,000. The value of the parking space that was to be provided, was established by the contract to be $15,000. As a result of the Contractor's breach, the solar system cost Owner $60,000. The value of the parking space is irrelevant for the calculation; therefore the difference between the contract price and the cover price was $10,000, which Owner can recover from Contractor.<br /><br /> LOST PROFITS<br /><br /> Generally, lost profits must be reasonably certain to be recoverable.<br /><br /> Here, this is a new establishment and profits would be very difficult to calculate. Therefore, lost profits resulting from the breach would likely not be recoverable and expectation damages will be limited to $10,000.<br /><br /> TAX REDUCTION<br /><br /> Under Hadley v. Baxendale the parties must contemplate damages at the time of contract formation. Here, though the contract stated that time was of the essence, the tax breaks were only instituted the day prior to the anticipatory repudiation. Neither party was aware of these yet-to-be-announced breaks; therefore they were not contemplated at the time of contract formation.<br /><br /> Therefore, the tax reduction will not be recoverable.<br /><br /> Therefore, in a breach of contract action, Owner will be able to recover $10,000 as a result of its increased cost to install system."

Mary and her friend Dan both assumed that it was a genuine autographed game ball used in that 1967 Super Bowl. Dan offered Mary $10,000 for the ball. In response, Mary wrote in pen on a napkin, \"Dan agrees to buy Mary's Bart Starr football for $10,000 on or before December 1, 2016.\" Dan signed the napkin in pen, and Mary kept the napkin without signing it.<br /><br /> As December approached, Dan was unable to come up with $10,000. Dan's friend Ed, who also assumed the ball was a genuine autographed 1967 Super Bowl game ball, wanted the ball, so Dan typed a document which read, \"Dan hereby assigns all of his rights to buy Mary's football to Ed; Ed hereby assumes all of Dan's obligations under Dan's contract with Mary to buy her football.\" Dan and Ed both signed three copies, each keeping one copy and sending one copy to Mary.<br /><br /> After some internet research, Ed discovered that while the Bart Starr autograph on the football was genuine, the football was not the type used in the 1967 game; it was instead a consumer product manufactured after 2005. The ball is worth about $1,000. Dan and Ed no longer wanted the ball. On December 2, 2016, Mary sued Dan and Ed for breach of contract.<br /><br /> 1. Can Mary prevail on her lawsuit? Discuss.<br /><br /> 2. If so, what damages, if any, is Mary entitled to recover, and from whom? Discuss.<br /><br /> 3.
