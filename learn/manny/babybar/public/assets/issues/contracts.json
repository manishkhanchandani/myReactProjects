			"essay": "Buyer opened a new automobile service station earlier this year. Buyer wanted to buy a television set for the station so her customers could watch television while she worked on their cars.<br /><br /> Buyer found the television set she wanted at Seller Sets, Inc. (\"Seller\"), a television set retailer. A Seller salesperson told Buyer she could purchase the set for $300. Buyer replied that she would like to \"shop around\". The salesperson then wrote \"Seller Sets, Inc. - $300\" on a sales brochure describing the set and gave the brochure to Buyer. The printed phrase \"Available for a Limited Time Only\" appeared at the top of the brochure. As the salesperson handed Buyer the brochure he said, \"I think you'll find no one will beat our price.\"<br /><br /> Not finding a better price, Buyer returned to Seller's one week later to buy the television set. However, the salesperson told her that the set was out of stock and that Seller could not sell her another at the $300 price. Two months later, Buyer purchased the same model set from another dealer for $450.<br /><br /> Buyer wishes to sue Seller, seeking damages for lost profits. Buyer intends to allege that she lost customers because she has not had television in the station for the past two months.<br /><br /> What theory or theories for recovery of damages will Buyer assert in her complaint and what is her likelihood of success on each theory? Discuss.",
