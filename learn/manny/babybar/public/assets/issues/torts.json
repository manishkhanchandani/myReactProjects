			"essay": "Craft Village is a small town that is popular with tourists because of its fine arts and crafts stores. Craft Village has no public transportation. All of the stores are located on Main Street. There is one large gallery, Northwoods Gallery, at the north end of Main Street. At the south end of Main Street is the Snooze Inn, a large motel. Tourists often stay at the Snooze Inn when they want to spend more than a day in Craft Village. Craft Village shops, by town ordinance, must remain open from at least 10:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. every day, including Sundays. All of the shops close at 8:00 p.m. except Northwoods Gallery, which is open until 11:00 p.m. every night. Craft Village provides street lighting along Main Street, which is turned on each night at dusk.<br /><br />Jean arrived in Craft Village on Sunday night for her annual shopping expedition. As on all of her previous trips to Craft Village, she stayed at the Snooze Inn for two nights. She does not own a car, and one of the reasons she likes Craft Village is that she can walk to all the shops.<br /><br />Jean got up on Monday morning to go shopping. She shopped all day, and walked back to the Snooze Inn at 7:00 p.m. for dinner. After dinner, at around 8:30 p.m., she began walking to Northwoods Gallery. Half way there, she was accosted by a mugger. The mugger stood in front of her and shouted, “Hand over your purse, or I’ll beat you up!” The mugger roughly snatched Jean’s purse as she held it out to him. The mugger fled, and Jean turned around and ran back to the Snooze Inn. The mugger was later captured by the police.<br /><br />On what theory or theories, if any, might Jean recover damages from, and what defenses might she anticipate, in an action against: <br /><br />1. The mugger? Discuss. <br /><br />2. Craft Village? Discuss. <br /><br />3. Northwoods Gallery? Discuss. <br /><br />4. Snooze Inn? Discuss.",

						"The intentional placing of another in reasonable apprehension of an immediate harm without consent or justification.<br /><br />When the mugger shouted at Jean to “Hand over your purse, or I'll beat you up,” his conduct was volitional and therefore intentional.<br /><br />Mere words are adequate to cause apprehension. The words “hand over your purse or I'll beat you up” coupled with the fact that he had the present ability to carry the threat out indicates the placing of another in reasonable apprehension.<br /><br />In addition, Jean held out the purse indicating that she was apprehensive. It does not seem that Mugger had consent or justification.<br /><br />Therefore, Mugger is liable for assault."

						"Battery is harmful or offensive touching of another without consent or justification.<br /><br />When Mugger roughly snatched Jean's purse from her he touched an item that was intimate to Jean's person, which was offensive.<br /><br />Therefore, there was a touching of another. There is not consent due to the fact Jean held her purse out because she was afraid and no justification.<br /><br />Therefore Mugger is liable for battery."

						"As a small town Craft Village owes a duty of due care not to subject visitors of the town to unreasonable harm as a reasonable small town in the same or similar circumstances.<br /><br />It may be argued that because Craft Village was a small town, with no public transportation, popular with tourists and all stores located on one main street that they owed a duty of care to the patrons of the village to make the streets safe. Especially in light of the fact the city required the stores to remain open until 8:00 p.m. which could be considered past dark and more inviting for crime.<br /><br /> Jean was a foreseeable plaintiff in that she was a tourist of the village out shopping. Therefore, Craft Village owed a duty."
