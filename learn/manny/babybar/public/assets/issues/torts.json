			"essay": "Craft Village is a small town that is popular with tourists because of its fine arts and crafts stores. Craft Village has no public transportation. All of the stores are located on Main Street. There is one large gallery, Northwoods Gallery, at the north end of Main Street. At the south end of Main Street is the Snooze Inn, a large motel. Tourists often stay at the Snooze Inn when they want to spend more than a day in Craft Village. Craft Village shops, by town ordinance, must remain open from at least 10:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. every day, including Sundays. All of the shops close at 8:00 p.m. except Northwoods Gallery, which is open until 11:00 p.m. every night. Craft Village provides street lighting along Main Street, which is turned on each night at dusk.<br /><br />Jean arrived in Craft Village on Sunday night for her annual shopping expedition. As on all of her previous trips to Craft Village, she stayed at the Snooze Inn for two nights. She does not own a car, and one of the reasons she likes Craft Village is that she can walk to all the shops.<br /><br />Jean got up on Monday morning to go shopping. She shopped all day, and walked back to the Snooze Inn at 7:00 p.m. for dinner. After dinner, at around 8:30 p.m., she began walking to Northwoods Gallery. Half way there, she was accosted by a mugger. The mugger stood in front of her and shouted, \"Hand over your purse, or I'll beat you up!\" The mugger roughly snatched Jean's purse as she held it out to him. The mugger fled, and Jean turned around and ran back to the Snooze Inn. The mugger was later captured by the police.<br /><br />On what theory or theories, if any, might Jean recover damages from, and what defenses might she anticipate, in an action against: <br /><br />1. The mugger? Discuss. <br /><br />2. Craft Village? Discuss. <br /><br />3. Northwoods Gallery? Discuss. <br /><br />4. Snooze Inn? Discuss.",

				"<b>Jean v. Mugger</b><br /><br /><b>Assault</b><br /><br />The intentional placing of another in reasonable apprehension of an immediate harm without consent or justification.<br /><br />When the mugger shouted at Jean to \"Hand over your purse, or I'll beat you up,\" his conduct was volitional and therefore intentional.<br /><br />Mere words are not adequate to cause apprehension. The words \"hand over your purse or I'll beat you up\" coupled with the fact that he had the present ability to carry the threat out indicates the placing of another in reasonable apprehension.<br /><br />In addition, Jean held out the purse indicating that she was apprehensive. It does not seem that Mugger had consent or justification.<br /><br />Therefore, Mugger is liable for assault.<br /><br /><b>Battery</b><br /><br />Battery is harmful or offensive touching of another without consent or justification.<br /><br />When Mugger roughly snatched Jean's purse from her he touched an item that was intimate to Jean's person, which was offensive.<br /><br />Therefore, there was a touching of another. There is not consent due to the fact Jean held her purse out because she was afraid and no justification.<br /><br />Therefore Mugger is liable for battery.<br /><br /><b>TRESPASS TO CHATTEL</b><br /><br />Trespass to chattel is the interference with the personal property of another.<br /><br />When Mugger roughly snatched Jean's purse and fled he interfered with the personal property, a purse, which belonged to Jean. Jean gave no consent and Mugger was not justified in his behavior.<br /><br />Thus, Mugger is liable for trespass to chattel. <br /><br />Jean may recover damages caused by the interference.<br /><br /><b>CONVERSION</b><br /><br />Conversion is the intentional exercise of dominion and control over the personal property of another.<br /><br />When Mugger snatched Jean's purse and fled he exercised dominion and control over Jean's personal property contrary to Jean's possessory rights.<br /><br />Therefore, Mugger is liable for conversion. Jean may recover for damages for the cost of the purse including value of the purse in a forced sale or reasonable rental value if returned, plus damages.<br /><br /><b>Jean v. Craft Village</b><br /><br /><b>Negligence</b><br /><br />Craft Village may be liable to Jean for damage if it is found that Craft Village owed a duty to Jean, that they breached their duty, which was the actual and proximate cause of Jean's injuries.<br /><br /><b>DUTY - GENERAL DUTY</b><br /><br />As a small town Craft Village owes a duty of due care not to subject visitors of the town to unreasonable harm as a reasonable small town in the same or similar circumstances.<br /><br />It may be argued that because Craft Village was a small town, with no public transportation, popular with tourists and all stores located on one main street that they owed a duty of care to the patrons of the village to make the streets safe. Especially in light of the fact the city required the stores to remain open until 8:00 p.m. which could be considered past dark and more inviting for crime.<br /><br /> Jean was a foreseeable plaintiff in that she was a tourist of the village out shopping. Therefore, Craft Village owed a duty.<br /><br /><b>SPECIAL DUTY - LAND OCCUPIER</b><br /><br />As a small town, Craft Village is the occupier of the city street, including Main Street. Jean will argue that Jean is an invitee because she was on the street for the purpose it was open to the public. Thus, Craft Village owed a duty to inspect, discover, warn or correct any harm.<br /><br />Even if Jean is determined to be a licensee Craft would owe a duty to warn or make safe any known harm.<br /><br />The facts do not indicate that Craft Village was aware of or had reason to inspect for any incidents of crime. There is no special duty owed.<br /><br /><b>BREACH</b><br /><br />Under the general duty of making the streets safe given the circumstances it may be argued that because it is such a small town with a large concentration of tourists in one location and keeping the business open after dark it is reasonable to provide adequate protection by police or security on Main Street. Especially because there is no public transport.<br /><br />Therefore, by failing to provide security, Craft Village breached its duty.<br /><br /><b>Causation</b><br /><br /><b>Actual cause</b><br /><br />But for failure to provide protection, Jean would not have been harmed.<br /><br /><b>Proximate Cause</b><br /><br />It is foreseeable given the above mentioned circumstances that a tourist like Jean would be mugged. Mugger is intervening force but Craft made crime more likely to occur. <br /><br />Thus, Craft Village is the proximate cause.<br /><br /><b>Damages</b><br /><br />General damages for pain and suffering. Special damages for loss of purse.<br /><br /><b>Defenses</b><br /><br /><b>Contributory Negligence</b><br /><br />Conduct which falls below the standard of care for one's own protection.<br /><br />Craft Village will argue that Jean went out on her own and did not protect herself. However, no facts indicate Jean's conduct contributed to her own injury. Not a valid defense.<br /><br /><b>Assumption of Risk</b><br /><br />A party assumes the risk if he knowingly undertakes an activity with full knowledge of the risk. <br /><br />No facts indicate Jean knew the risk of a robbery occurring. Assumption of risk is an invalid defense.<br /><br /><b>Immunity</b><br /><br />As a city, Craft Village will seek immunity. However, the act of maintain[ing] Main Street was proprietary in nature and not immune.<br /><br /><b>Jean v. Northwood Gallery (Northwoods)</b><br /><br /><b>Negligence</b><br /><br />Defined supra.<br /><br /><b>Duty</b><br /><br />Special duty - As a store owner Northwoods owed a duty to all its invitee patrons to inspect, discover and warn of any angers. However, Jean was not a patron or even on Northwoods' property.<br /><br /> Therefore, there is no duty owed to Jean.<br /><br /><b>General Duty</b><br /><br />Not to subject patrons to unreasonable harm. Northwoods owes no general duty because Jean was not patron.<br /><br /><b>Jean v. Snooze Inn (Snooze)</b><br /><br /><b>Negligence</b><br /><br />Defined supra.<br /><br /><b>Duty as an innkeeper</b>, Snooze owes a higher standard of care, including to protect guests from harm and partake in a course of conduct which causes the least harm. <br /><br />Jean was a guest and therefore a duty was owed.<br /><br /><b>Breach</b><br /><br />By failing to provide protection or some type of shuttle service for its guests, Snooze's actions were below the standard of care of a reasonable innkeeper in the same or similar circumstances. Especially given the concentration of tourists which increases the likelihood of crime. Thus Snooze breached its duty of care to Jean.<br /><br /><b>Causation</b><br /><br /><b>Actual Cause</b><br /><br />But for Snooze's failure to adequately protect Jean, Jean would not have been robbed.<br /><br />Snooze is the actual cause.<br /><br /><b>Proximate Cause</b><br /><br />It is foreseeable that it being after hours and in a tourist area that a person will be robbed. Snooze will claim Mugger's actions were an intervening force. However, Mugger's conduct was the type of harm they were obligated to protect against, thus not superceding.<br /><br />Thus, Snooze is the proximate cause.<br /><br /><b>Damages</b><br /><br />As discussed under negligence of Craft Village. Jean is entitled to general and special damages.<br /><br /><b>Defenses</b><br /><br /><b>Contributory Negligence</b><br /><br />This will fail as discussed above.<br /><br /><b>Assumption of Risk</b><br /><br />This will fail as discussed above.<br /><br /><b>Indemnity</b><br /><br />If Snooze is found secondarily liable then they may seek indemnity from Craft Village.<br /><br /><b>Contribution</b><br /><br />Joint tortfeasor may seek reimbursement from other tortfeasor. <br /><br />Craft Village and Snooze may file for contribution against each other.",
				"<b>Jean v. Mugger</b><br /><br /><b>1. Issue - Is Mugger Liable to Jean for Tortious Assault?</b><br /><br />Under common law, assault is the voluntary act with intent to place another in immediate apprehension of a battery (harmful/or offensive contact). Here Mugger, expressly \"threatened\" Jean by saying, \"Hand over your purse or I'll beat you up.\" This express threat is sufficient and of which Jean was aware to cause a reasonable person in immediate apprehension of being beat up (harmful/offensive contact). Therefore Mugger will be liable to Jean for assault.<br /><br /><b>2. Issue - Is Mugger liable to Jean for Tortious Battery?</b><br /><br />Under common law, battery is the voluntary act with intent to cause harmful/offensive contact and does cause such contact. Here, Mugger used his threat to obtain the purse. Because Jean actually held her purse out to him, rather than him taking it by force (no harmful/offensive contact occurred), Mugger will probably not be liable for battery.<br /><br /><b>3. Issue - Is Mugger liable to Jean for Conversion?</b><br /><br />Conversion is the unreasonable interference with another person's chattel to sufficiently dispossess them of it. Here, Mugger's interference is the crime of robbery (Trespassory taking and carrying away of personal property of another with the intent to permanently deprive for the person/presence of through the use of force or fear). Because his words and actions expressed that he intended to take and keep the purse, which he in fact did, Mugger will be liable to Jean for conversion.<br /><br /><b>Jean v. Craft Village</b><br /><br /><b>4. Issue - Can Craft Village be liable to Jean for negligence?</b><br /><br />Negligence is the failure to use due care that a reasonable person would use in the same or similar circumstances. A prima facie case of negligence requires the showing of the elements of duty, breach, actual and proximate cause and damages.<br /><br /><b>5. Did Craft Village owe Jean a Duty?</b><br /><br />Under common law, the duty owed is that of reasonable or due care under most situations where there is a duty owed. Normally there is no duty to strangers, absent a special relationship or statute. Where duty is owed by relationship, varying standards of care may be imposed depending on the nature of the relationship. Here, at minimum, the town is required to use due care in the protection of their citizens and visitors.<br /><br /><b>6. Did Craft Village owe Jean a higher standard of duty?</b><br /><br />Craft Village is a town [in] which streets are open to the public. Jean's status as a public invitee (licensee) requires that the town exercise a higher standard of care. The standard required is to warn of known dangers. If the town knew or should have known they had a problem with crime, they have a duty to warn/repair.<br /><br /><b>7. Did Craft Village breach their duty?</b><br /><br />Breach occurs when the defendant fails to use reasonable care. Here, the town provided street lighting which may be viewed as a reasonable care to deter crimes which often happen in the dark, such as robbery. The town also required all businesses to remain open until 8:00, that could be to ensure that there are a lot of people around during \"core\" hours, which provides another level of protection from crime. However, if Craft knew or should have know they had a crime problem, and these security features they've employed (lights, hours) are not sufficiently reasonable to mitigate the threat of crime, they may be found to have breached their duty. Absent their knowledge of the crime, Craft will not be found to have breached.<br /><br /><b>8. Was Craft Village actions the legal/proximate cause?</b><br /><br />Unless it can be found that Craft Village failed to act reasonably in the protections it provided, the town itself is not the legal or proximate cause of Jean's mugging, the mugger is. Therefore the town will not be held responsible.<br /><br /><b>Jean v. Northwoods</b><br /><br /><b>9. Issue - Can Northwoods be liable to Jean in negligence?</b><br /><br />Negligence and its elements are discussed above. Northwoods may owe a duty to its customers to discover and repair all known dangers. Here, Jean only made it halfway to the store, so she wasn't on the premises. However, Northwoods is the only store that stays open until 11:00 pm at night. Therefore if it can be found that Northwoods' late hours are not reasonable for the safety of its customers, they may owe a duty to warn its customers of potential dangers to include criminal activity in the area.<br /><br />ACTUAL CAUSE - is the \"cause in fact\" of the harm done. PROXIMATE CAUSE - is the legal scope of responsibility. Under Palsgraf, Cardozo asserted that one is responsible for those plaintiffs in the zone of danger, however, Andrews asserted a duty to one is a duty to all. Here, the Mugger is the \"But, for\" or cause in fact of Jean's mugging (Damages). However, if Northwoods' late hours are a substantial factor in her mugging (Jean wouldn't have been on the street after 8:00 because the other stores close then), and on the street to the store is sufficiently within the zone of danger, then Northwoods may be found to have had a duty which they breached.<br /><br /><b>Jean v. Snooze Inn</b><br /><br /><b>10. Can Snooze Inn be liable to Jean for negligence?</b><br /><br />Negligence (see supra). As an innkeeper, Snooze Inn owes a duty of care to its patrons. Jean was a patron of the hotel as she stayed overnight for two days. The standard of care of innkeepers is determined by a special relationship under which Jean was an invitee. Under this standard, the hotel will have a duty to warn of all known dangers, including a danger of criminal activity if they knew or should have known. Absent the knowing of this fact, Snooze Inn, there are no facts to show that Snooze failed to act reasonably. Therefore, they will not be liable to Jean for Negligence.<br /><br /><b>11. Does Northwoods/Snooze/Craft have a defense of assumption of the risk?</b><br /><br />Assumption of the risk is when a person knows and appreciates the nature of risks inherent to an activity and assumes that risk by voluntarily proceeding with the activity. Here, Jean, as a visitor, may not have known of the crime potential in the town. However, the fact that all but one of the stores close at 8:00 pm may be an indicator that the town does not want people on the streets after that time. The fact that Northwoods was open until later may negate that logic. If a reasonable person would not walk in the streets after 8:00 because of obvious dangers or risks (especially to a woman traveling alone), the business and hotel may be able to assert the defense of assumption of the risk. Assumption of the risk is a complete bar to the plaintiff's recovery.<br /><br /><b>12. Does Northwoods/Snooze/Craft have a defense of comparative negligence?</b><br /><br />At common law, a person has the responsibility to act reasonably for the protection of their own self. Here if Jean was not acting reasonably in walking alone, after dark, on an unoccupied street, the hotel/business may be able to assert comparative negligence which is a partial bar to recovery. Jean's recovery will be apportionately reduced by the percentage of fault attributed to her. In some jurisdictions, comparative fault is a complete bar, if the percentage of fault of the plaintiff is half or more (51%).<br /><br />"

The child petted the zebra and offered it a stick of candy. In taking the candy from the child the zebra bit off one of the child's fingers.<br /><br /> On what theory or theories of liability might an action be brought against the zoo on behalf of the child and what should be the likely outcome of such action? Discuss.",
			"sampleAnswers": [
				"<b>I. Child vs. Zoo</b><br /><br /> <b>Strict Liability.</b> For the child to recover against zoo in strict liability she must simply show that the wild animal causing her injury was owned by or under the care of the zoo and that she suffered injury that were [sic] of the type consistent with foreseeable harm by the wild animal. This is because owners/caretakers of wild animals are strictly liable for the reasonable and foreseeable harm caused by the wild animal.<br /><br /> Here, the zebra was clearly under the care/control of the zoo when it escaped from its cage. As such, zoo would be strictly liable for any reasonable/foreseeable harm the animal causes.<br /><br /> Zoo will argue that the child assumed the risk when it petted the zebra and offered it a stick of candy. However, given the fact that the zebra is generally considered to be a wild animal, and that it is foreseeable that it could bite if in close proximity to a person, this would not relieve zoo's liability.<br /><br /> <b>II. Child vs. Zoo</b><br /><br /> <b>Negligence.</b> For child to recover against zoo in negligence, she must show duty, breach of that duty, causation, and damages.<br /><br /> [Note: Zoo's liability would be based on various liability under the theory of respondeat superior as the zoo's employer (Maintenance Man), and the performance of his duty, set into motion the series of events that resulted in child's injury.]<br /><br /> <b>Duty.</b> Duty arises when there is a legally recognized relationship between plaintiff and defendant that results in defendant having to act is [sic] some fashion other than arbitrarily towards plaintiff. The duty owed is one of reasonable care towards all foreseeable plaintiffs in the zone of danger created by defendant's negligence.<br /><br /> At common law, duty was largely based on one's status in relationship to defendant. One could be an invitee, a licensee, or a trespasser. Here the child plaintiff was not on defendant's property at the time of the accident, but rather was in a residential area \"nearby\" the zoo. As zoo is in the business of housing, caring for, and maintaining wild animals, it should be reasonably foreseeable that an accident could arise that would result in an animal being left loose in the nearby community, and because of the nature of a wild animal's behavior, harm could have resulted to a person in the nearby community. This is particularly true where children are around.<br /><br /> <b>Breach of Duty.</b> Breach of duty arises when defendant's actions do not rise to the standard of care required by the law. Here, Learned Hand's approach would note that the zoo breached its duty if the cost incurred with avoiding the harm causing incident was less than the product of the probability of the harm causing incident arising and the magnitude of loss should the harm causing event occur.<br /><br /> Here, a fire caused a large water main to break with the ensuing rush of water washing away a portion of the zebra's pen fence. When considering a pen fence, (as opposed to a sturdy cage), it's entirely foreseeable that a sudden deluge of water could wash away a portion of the \"fence.\" As such, the zoo should have ensured construction of a caged facility that would be sturdy enough to withstand this type of accident.<br /><br /> The cost involved with the construction of a pen of this nature would be significantly less than the potential danger that a wild animal could cause to men, women, and children in a nearby area should that animal escape. As such, it could be argued that the zoo breached its duty.<br /><br /> <b>Causation.</b> For liability to arise, the zoo (or in this case, the zoo's employee) would have to be both actual and primary cause of the child's injury.<br /><br /> <b>Actual Cause.</b> Actual cause arises when \"but for\" defendant's actions, plaintiff would not have been injured. Here, the zoo's maintenance employee threw a pile of cleaning rags saturated with a flammable cleaning fluid into a hot, enclosed room. The maintenance man should have known that there was the potential for the rags igniting resulting in a fire. When this happened, the fire set into motion a series of events that resulted in the zebra getting free and the child being bitten. As such, \"but for\" the maintenance man's action, the child's injury would not have occurred.<br /><br /> <b>Proximate Cause.</b> Arises when a result is the natur[al] and probable/reasonable and foreseeable consequences of defendant's actions. Here, we look to see if the injury is of the type reasonably expected, or was significantly more severe than reasonably expected. Here, there was a fire, that resulted in a water main bursting, that resulted in a fence being washed away, that led to a zebra escaping, that resulted in a child being bitten by the zebra. The zoo could reasonably argue that the type of injury resulting to the child was not of the type that would be the foreseeable natural consequence of a fire that caused a water main to break. As such, they could avoid liability as the maintenance man's actions would not be the proximate cause of the child's injury.<br /><br /> <b>Defenses.</b> At common law, contributing negligence was a complete bar to recovery. Here, the zoo could argue that the child was contributorily negligent when she petted the zebra and fed it candy. If the court argued, child would be barred from recovery.<br /><br /> <b>Comparative Fault. </b>Today, most jurisdictions have adopted comparative fault. Here, the could [sic] would weight [sic] the percentage of responsibility on each of the parties and assess damages accordingly. If child was less at fault than zoo, she could recover accordingly.<br /><br /> <b>Assumption of Risk.</b> If it can be shown that the child knew the consequences of her actions and knowingly embraced the danger, this could bar her from recovery. This would be a matter of fact for the court to decide.",
				"<b>Child v. Zoo</b><br /><br /> <b>Strict Liability</b><br /><br /> Owners of trespassing wild animals will be held strictly liable (no fault need be shown) for damages proximately caused by the animals.<br /><br /> <b>Zebra a Wild Animal?</b> A wild animal is one that is not domesticated (does not serve man). A zebra is a wild animal because its only use is to be displayed in a zoo. This zebra is from a zoo and thus is considered wild.<br /><br /> <b>Causation.</b><br /><br /> The damage to the child was both actually (BUT-FOR TEST) and proximately (LEGALLY) caused by the zebra because the zebra bit off the child's fingers [sic]. But for this biting, the child would not have lost his fingers [sic]. There are no superseding causes.<br /><br /> <b>Damages.</b> The child lost his fingers [sic].<br /><br /> <b>Defense.</b> Because contributory negligence is not a defense to strict liability, the only question is whether Child assumed the risk.<br /><br /> <b>ASSUMPTION OF RISK</b> requires plaintiff to understand the nature and extent of the risk and to disregard that risk. Here there is no evidence that Child apprehended a risk when approaching the Zebra. Indeed, Child's offer of candy was a friendly gesture that showed Child probably was comfortable and had no idea that his fingers were in danger.<br /><br /> Therefore Child did not assume the risk of injury.<br /><br /> <b>Domestic Animal?</b><br /><br /> Zoo could try to claim that, like a horse, a Zebra is a domestic animal, and as such, Zoo would not be strictly liable unless the zebra had known dangerous tendencies. However, this claim should be dismissed because a zebra only looks like a horse; they [sic] are not, however, domesticated.<br /><br /> Under the facts Child should be able to recover from Zoo in Strict Liability.<br /><br /> <b>Negligence?</b><br /><br /> Negligence is conduct that falls below the standard of care set by law to protect others from unreasonable risk of harm.<br /><br /> Here Child may also assert a claim in negligence if he can show that Zoo breached an owed duty to him, actually and proximately causing Child's damages.<br /><br /> <b>Vicarious Liability</b><br /><br /> Under the doctrine of RESPONDEAT SUPERIOR Zoo will be liable for torts committed by its employees if they act within the scope of their duties.<br /><br /> Here the maintenance employee was doing his duties, cleaning up, when he threw the rag into the hot room. Zoo will be liable for any tort arising from this act if it is tortious.<br /><br /> <b>Duty.</b><br /><br /> Zoo owes a duty to act as a reasonable zoo. In addition, as possessor of land, they owe a duty not to harm others outside their land by activities on the land.<br /><br /> <b>Breach.</b><br /><br /> Under Cardozo from the Palsgraf decision a duty is owed to all foreseeable plaintiffs, generally within the zone of the activity. Here it is foreseeable that an escaped Zebra would run into civilians and so Zoo was under a duty to be very careful this wouldn't happen.<br /><br /> Here Zoo breached this duty in possibly several ways.<br /><br /> 1. First, Child could argue that Zoo's employee was negligent in not realizing that a rag soaked with a flammable liquid could spontaneously combust in a hot enclosed room. This, however, is a poor argument because most maintenance men do not have that understanding of physics and chemistry.<br /><br /> 2. Second, Child could claim that Zoo did not build a strong enough fence to keep the zebras penned in. This is not so strong either because the force from the broken water main probably exceeded any natural force that could reasonably be foreseen. But if the fence was not strong for normal wear and tear Child could show breach here.<br /><br /> 3. A third argument, much better, is that Zoo has a duty to notice when wild animals escape and has ready plans to round them up or tranquilize them if they do escape. Here it seems Zoo did nothing while the zebra ran away. Therefore Zoo has breached its duty to control its animals.<br /><br /> <b>Causation.</b> Zoo might claim that the Child's offer of candy was superseding cause that breaks the chain of proximate causation. However, Child would have to be doing something independent and unforeseeable for Zoo to prevail. While carrying candy is not a response to an escaped zebra, it is not unforeseeable that a child should have candy, nor is it unforeseeable that such a child might offer it to the zebra.<br /><br /> <b>Damages.</b><br /><br /> Discussed supra.<br /><br /> <b>Defenses.</b><br /><br /> <b>CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE</b> is conduct by the plaintiff that fails to conform to the standard of care set by law for the plaintiff's own protection. Here a CHILD STANDARD OF CARE applies. Child will be expected to act as a reasonable child of similar age, experience, and education will act in similar circumstances.<br /><br /> Here Child's behavior is typical of a \"young child\" and is therefore not negligent.<br /><br /> <b>ASSUMPTION OF RISK</b> fails for the similar reason as discussed supra.<br /><br /> Therefore Child could also recover for his damages under Negligence theory."

She was aware that Attendant was sometimes careless in his work. Attendant, given the clothes he wears, could not be mistaken for a police officer.<br /><br /> One morning, distracted by the line of honking cars that wished to exit the lot, Attendant waved Customer's car out of the parking lot with only a hurried glance to determine if the street was clear. Customer heeded Attendant's signal to exit the lot, but was distracted by her crying baby in the back seat and did not check to see if the street was clear. Businessman, who was driving toward Flora's shop, was dialing his cellular phone, and did not see Customer's car exiting the lot.<br /><br /> Businessman, whose driver's license had expired, collided with Customer. Both drivers were injured and both cars were damaged.<br /><br /> It is a crime to drive with an expired driver's license. It is also a crime to employ a parking attendant who does not possess a special parking attendant license which costs $50, and requires three hours of safety training relating to operating a parking lot.

				"<b>I. CUSTOMER v. BUSINESSMAN</b><br /><br /> <b>A. NEGLIGENCE</b> A negligence action will arise when one party has acted with an unreasonable amount of risk causing harm to another party where a duty is owed to avoid that risk. Here, Businessman and Customer have a traffic accident in which both drivers are injured and Customer is bringing an action for damages against Businessman.<br /><br /> <b>1. DUTY.</b> Duty is avoiding an unreasonable risk of harm to another person. Generally, duty is owed any time the party acts, called malfeasance. In cases of nonfeasance, that is, a failure to act, duty is only owed under special circumstances. Here Businessman was driving down the street toward the flower shop. As a driver, Businessman has a duty to drive reasonably to avoid the risk of harm to others on the street.<br /><br /> <b>2. STANDARD OF CARE</b> <b>a. GENERAL STANDARD OF CARE.</b> Generally, the standard of care ascribed to the duty owed is that of a reasonably prudent person in the same or similar circumstances. Here, Businessman would be expected to maintain a standard of care to the other drivers, that is, in line with the actions of any reasonably prudent driver driving toward the flower shop. Since Flora has erected a sign visible to drivers asking for extra caution in this area, the circumstances would demand that any reasonably prudent driver in this area would take extra care to avoid harm to others.<br /><br /> <b>b. STANDARD OF CARE BASED UPON A CRIMINAL STATUTE.</b><br /><br /> Sometimes, if there is an applicable criminal statute, the standard of care mandated by that statute may be used to define the standard of care required under negligence. Here, there is a statute that requires a drive[r] to have a valid license. Businessman's license has expired. He has violated the statute. However, when the statute merely applies to licensing and the collection of funds, it will generally not be used to define the standard of care under negligence. Here Businessman's expired license will not be used to define his standard of care when driving his car.<br /><br /> <b>3. BREACH OF DUTY.</b><br /><br /> <b>a. GENERAL BREACH OF DUTY.</b> A breach of duty exists when the avoidance of harm is less than the probability of harm and the probable severity of that harm (The Hand theory). Here, Businessman is driving in an area known as a dangerous intersection. The intersection has been the site of recent accidents and there is a sign asking for extra caution. It would be very easy for Businessman to heed the sign, put down his cellular phone, and take a little extra time and care in respect for the intersection. Weighing the ease with which Businessman could pay more attention against the probability of an accident (it is a dangerous intersection) and the possible severity of harm (auto accidents are always costly in both personal and property damage), shows that Businessman has breached his duty.<br /><br /> <b>b. BREACH OF DUTY BASED ON A STATUTE--NEGLIGENCE PER SE.</b> If there is an applicable criminal statute which may be used to define the standard of care, and that statute defines both the type of harm that has been caused and the harm has been caused to the class of people the statute was designed to protect, then the statute may be used to define the breach of duty. Here, Businessman has an expired license. The statute will not be applicable for negligence per se. See above.<br /><br /> <b>4. CAUSE IN FACT.</b> The harm that the plaintiff suffers must result directly from the action of the defendant, or the defendant's action must have been a substantial factor in causing that harm. Here, Business[sic] collided with Customer. He has actually caused her harm.<br /><br /> <b>5. PROXIMATE CAUSE.</b> The harm caused must also occur without any foreseeable superceding or intervening events which have broken the chain of events from the defendant's actions to the plaintiff's harm. Here Businessman runs into Customer. There are no superceding or intervening events. Businessman's act is the proximate as well as actual cause of Customer's harm.<br /><br /> <b>6. DAMAGES.</b> To recover in negligence, there must be actual damages. Here, both Customer and Businessman were injured. There were actual damages.<br /><br /> <b>7. DEFENSES.</b> Defenses available to the defendant include assumption of risk, comparative negligence, and contributory negligence (minority of jurisdictions).<br /><br /> <b>a. ASSUMPTION OF RISK.</b> If the plaintiff knows of the risk and has voluntarily decided to continue with his own actions taking that knowledge into consideration, he is said to have assumed the risk of his own activity. Here, Customer has chosen to drive her car; however, there is no indic[a]tion that she has assumed any special risk for that ordinary task. She certainly has not assumed the risk of being hit by Businessman at this particular time. Customer has not assumed the risk.<br /><br /> <b>b. COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE.</b> If the plaintiff is also acting negligently is[sic] his actions, he may be liable for part of his own damages. Total liability to the defendant will NOT be relieved. However, plaintiff may be responsible for a proportionate amount of his own damages with respect to his own level of liability. Here, Customer was distracted by her baby in the back seat. Her distraction indicates that she may have been neglecting to pay proper attention to her own driving and under the circumstances may also be considered negligent.<br /><br /> <b>c. CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE.</b> In some jurisdictions, negligence of the plaintiff will relieve the defendant of all liability. If this is a Contributory negligence jurisdiction, defendant will escape liability based on Customer's own liability.<br /><br /> <b>II. CUSTOMER v. FLORA</b><br /><br /> <b>A. NEGLIGENCE</b><br /><br /> <b>1. DUTY.</b> See above.<br /><br /> <b>2. STANDARD OF CARE.</b> See above. Here, Flora is a shop owner and knows that the traffic leaving her property is at greater risk for injury than normal. She has taken certain steps to alleviate the situation, such as posting a sign and hiring an attendant.<br /><br /> <b>a. STATUTORY STANDARD OF CARE.</b> See above. Here, the applicable statute requires an employer to have a special license and for the attendant to get special training. Flora has neglected to do either. She has not met the requisite standard of care as defined by the statute. <b>b. RESPONDEAT SUPERIOR.</b> As an employer, Flora is responsible for the actions of her employees in conjunction with the job they perform. Flora is aware that Attendant is sometime careless in his work, which is also less than the standard of care that an ordinarily prudent employer would take in same or similar circumstances.<br /><br /> <b>3. BREACH OF DUTY.</b><br /><br /> <b>a. NEGLIGENCE PER SE.</b> See above. Here, the class of people protected by the statute would be the drivers the trained attendant would be expected to help or protect. The type of harm addressed by the statute would be the harm resulting from auto accidents. Thus, here the statute is applicable to both the class of people harmed and the type of harm addressed. The statute could be used to establish a breach of duty by Flora since Flora has violated the statute.<br /><br /> <b>4. CAUSE IN FACT.</b> See above. The fact that Flora did not hire a properly trained attendant was a substantial factor in the harm caused to Customer. Attendant was not doing his job properly and waved Customer's car into oncoming traffic. Flora as the employer is responsible for attendant. Customer's harm is a cause in fact of Flora's actions of hiring an untrained attendant.<br /><br /> <b>5. PROXIMATE CAUSE.</b> See above. There were no intervening/superceding events and all were foreseeable.<br /><br /> <b>6. DAMAGES.</b> See above.<br /><br /> <b>7. DEFENSES.</b> See above. Flora will argue that Customer was also negligent.<br /><br /> <b>III. BUSINESSMAN v. FLORA</b><br /><br /> <b>A. NEGLIGENCE</b><br /><br /> <b>1. DUTY.</b> See above.<br /><br /> <b>2. STANDARD OF CARE.</b> See above.<br /><br /> <b>3. BREACH OF DUTY.</b> See above.<br /><br /> <b>4. CAUSE IN FACT. </b>Since the Attendant sent Customer out into the traffic in front of Businessman, and this caused Businessman to run into Customer, Flora's liability would be the same as her liability for Customer.<br /><br /> <b>5. PROXIMATE CAUSE.</b> See above.<br /><br /> <b>6. DAMAGES.</b> See above.<br /><br /> <b>7. DEFENSES.</b> Flora will argue that Businessman was also negligent.<br /><br /> <b>IV. CUSTOMER & BUSINESSMAN v. ATTENDANT</b><br /><br /> <b>A. NEGLIGENCE</b><br /><br /> <b>1. DUTY.</b> See above. Attendant has a duty to perform his job to avoid an unreasonable risk of harm to Businessman and Customer.<br /><br /> <b>2. STANDARD OF CARE.</b> Attendant's standard of care will be that of a trained attendant as defined by the statute, though it is not Attendant's responsibility to obtain that training. He will be expected to perform as a reasonably prudent parking attendant under same or similar circumstances.<br /><br /> <b>3. BREACH OF DUTY.</b> See above. Attendant was distracted by the honking horns and subsequently did not pay adequate attention to sending Customer's car into traffic. The utility of paying attention is small compared to the possible harm from wrecks. Here, Attendant himself had breached his duty of care to be a reasonably prudent attendant.<br /><br /> <b>4. CAUSE IN FACT.</b> See above. Had attendant not sent Customer into traffic, she would not have been hit by Businessman.<br /><br /> <b>5. PROXIMATE CAUSE.</b> See above.<br /><br /> <b>6. DAMAGES.</b> See above.<br /><br /> <b>7. DEFENSES.</b> Attendant will argue that both Customer and Business[sic] were negligent in their actions."

			"essay": "Peter, walking along the street at 10:00 p.m. on April 20, urgently needed to find a restroom. Just ahead was Dell's Supper Club (\"Dell's\"), which Peter had patronized a few times in the past. There was a sign on the door of Dell's that said \"Restrooms for Patrons Only.\" He was not familiar with Dell's restroom. He entered the dimly lit club and was directed by a waitress toward a door marked \"MEN\". Peter opened this door and stepped into an even darker room. Just inside the door, Peter felt for and pushed a light switch, but no light came on because the bulb in the ceiling fixture was burned out. Nevertheless, Peter walked towards what he thought was the toilet, but tripped over a step, fell, and suffered severe cuts and bruises.<br /><br /> Later that night at Dell's John ordered a steak with mushrooms. Dell's used canned mushrooms purchased from Acme Foods, which three weeks earlier had discovered that some of its canned mushrooms had been improperly prepared and if eaten could cause botulism. Acme Foods notified all its customers of the problems with the canned mushrooms and offered to replace any cans of mushrooms purchased from them. Dell's received this notice, but disregarded it. John was served some of the mushrooms in question and as a result contracted botulism, recovering only after five days of severe illness and hospital treatment.<br /><br /> At 6:00 a.m. the next morning Carl, who was paid to pick up the garbage at Dell's, drove to the back of the club to carry out his duties. He did not see Dell's large guard dog chained next to the bin to keep out trespassers, and the dog was asleep when Carl entered the bin. As Carl walked to the bin, he startled the dog and it attacked Carl. The dog grabbed Carl's shoe and held on tightly. Carl managed to get his foot out of the shoe, ran to the fence surrounding the back of the restaurant, and climbed over it to get away from the dog. Once he reached the top of the fence, he fell to the ground on the other side and broke his leg.<br /><br /> What actions could Peter, John and Carl assert against Dell's, what defenses should Dell's assert, and what would be the probable results?

				"<b>Negligence</b><br /><br /> Under tort law negligence is a failure to act as a reasonably prudent person in the same circumstances. A prima facie case of negligence requires a showing of duty, breach, proximate and actual causation, and damages.<br /><br /> <b>1. Peter v. Dell's (P v. D)</b><br /><br /> <b>A. Negligence</b><br /><br /> <b>1. Standard of care</b><br /><br /> Under tort law the standard of care is that of a reasonably prudent person in the same situation.<br /><br /> Here D is a landowner because P was injured on their property.<br /><br /> Therefore D is held to the standard of care of other landowners.<br /><br /> <b>2. Duty</b><br /><br /> Under common law there was no general duty to act affirmatively to protect others.<br /><br /> Under Palsgraf, Cordozo argued that D owes a duty only to those in the zone of danger to protect foreseeable plaintiffs from foreseeable harm.<br /><br /> Andrews argued that if D owes a duty to anyone he owes a duty to everyone.<br /><br /> Here there is a special duty because D is a landowner as discussed above.<br /><br /> The specific level of duty D owes to P depends on the status of P.<br /><br /> <b>A. P as trespasser</b><br /><br /> Under common law landowners owed no duty to trespassers. Modernly landowners owe a duty to known trespassers to avoid from actively causing them harm from the landowner's use or activities on the land.<br /><br /> Here P may be considered a known trespasser because although he was not going to buy anything at D's the waitress knew that he was going into the restroom marked for patrons only because the waitress directed him there.<br /><br /> Therefore if P is considered a known trespasser D owed him a duty not to actively cause him harm from their use or activities on the land.<br /><br /> <b>B. P as licensee</b><br /><br /> Under tort law landowners owe a duty to licensee, those on the property with permission but not to convey a benefit to landowner, to warn them of known artificial dangers on their land.<br /><br /> Here P may be considered a licensee because although he did not intend to buy anything this time he had visited a few times in the past and as D was a \"Supper Club\" it may be reasonable to find that P was licensed to enter D's land.<br /><br /> Therefore if P is considered a known trespasser D owed him a duty to warn of known artificial dangers on the land.<br /><br /> <b>3. Breach</b><br /><br /> Under the Learned Hand Calculus breach can be found where the burden of preventing the harm to P combined with the social utility of D's acts are not outweighed by the likelihood of harm occurring to P times the magnitude of harm which might occur.<br /><br /> Here the burden of preventing the harm to P may have been small if the bulb has been out for awhile and no one at D's inspected the restroom periodically.<br /><br /> Here there is no social utility in not checking the restrooms.<br /><br /> Here the likelihood of injury is high because it is reasonable to find that if a lightbulb is burnt out that someone may hurt themselves in the dark.<br /><br /> Here the magnitude of harm is high because a restroom is a potentially dangerous place in the dark and someone could fall and hit their head causing serious harm or even death.<br /><br /> Therefore D breached his duty to P.<br /><br /> <b>4. Actual cause</b><br /><br /> Under tort law actual causation will be found where but/for the negligence of D the plaintiff would not have been harmed.<br /><br /> Here but/for D's negligence is [sic] not changing the lightbulb P would not have been harmed because P would have seen the step and not tripped.<br /><br /> Therefore D is an actual cause of P's harm.<br /><br /> <b>5. Proximate cause</b><br /><br /> Under tort law P's injury must not have occurred in a way to [sic] unforeseen or removed from the negligent acts of the defendant.<br /><br /> Here P's injury was foreseeable because as discussed above P fell because there was no light and it is reasonably foreseeable that if there is no light in a bathroom someone could get hurt.<br /><br /> Here there are no intervening acts because although the bulb burnt [sic] out it['s] not unforeseeable, because bulbs burn out all the time.<br /><br /> Therefore D is the proximate cause of P's harm.<br /><br /> <b>6. Damages</b><br /><br /> Under tort law victims of negligence must suffer damages in order to be compensated. Here P suffered damages because he suffered severe cuts and bruises. Therefore P suffered compensable damages.<br /><br /> <b>B. D's defenses</b><br /><br /> <b>1. Contributory negligence</b><br /><br /> Under tort law contributory negligence is a minority doctrine that any negligence by P acts as a complete bar to recovery. Even in a contributory negligence jurisdiction P can recover if D had the \"last chance\" to prevent the harm to P.<br /><br /> Here there if [sic] contributory negligence because P saw that the light didn't come on but went into the restroom anyway.<br /><br /> Here D did not have the last change [sic] to prevent P's harm because P could have avoided the harm at the last change [sic] by not entering.<br /><br /> Therefore in a contributory negligence jurisdiction D would have a defense to P's claim of negligence.<br /><br /> <b>2. Comparative negligence</b><br /><br /> Under tort law comparative negligence is a majority doctrine that any negligence by P is not a bar to recovery but acts to reduce the damages payable by D by the percentage that P's own negligence contributed to his own injuries.<br /><br /> Here as discussed above P was also negligent in entering a dark room.<br /><br /> Therefore in a comparative negligence jurisdiction any award for damages to P would be reduced by the percent of his own negligence.<br /><br /> <b>3. Assumption of the risk</b><br /><br /> Under tort law if P knowingly and voluntarily assumes the risk of his own actions it is a complete bar to recovery.<br /><br /> Here P knew that the room was dark but he did not know that there was a step in the room. Therefore although he voluntarily entered the room he did not do so with a complete knowledge of the risk he was assuming and assumption of the risk fails as a defense to D's negligence.<br /><br /> <b>2. John v. Dell (J v. D)</b><br /><br /> <b>A. Strict liability in tort</b><br /><br /> Under tort law those in the chain of marketing are strictly liable for injuries caused by defective products.<br /><br /> <b>1. Manufacturing defect</b><br /><br /> Under tort law a manufacturing defect exists when a product is not produced as designed and such manufacturing defect causes injury. Here there is a manufacturing defect because the mushrooms were improperly prepared and could cause botulism.<br /><br /> <b>a. Consumer expectation test</b><br /><br /> Under the consumer expectation test a product defect exists if the product fails to function as a reasonable consumer would expect.<br /><br /> Here there is a failure of the consumer expectation test because a reasonably [sic] consumer would not expect a mushroom to cause botulism.<br /><br /> <b>2. Proper plaintiff</b><br /><br /> Under strict liability in torts a duty is owed to foreseeable users and those foreseeably affected by the defective product.<br /><br /> Here there is a foreseeable user because it is foreseeable that a restaurant would buy mushrooms and use them in food they served to their guests.<br /><br /> Therefore J is a foreseeable user.<br /><br /> <b>3. Proper defendant</b><br /><br /> Under strict liability in torts all those in the chain of marketing a defective product are liable for the harm caused.<br /><br /> Here D is in the chain of marketing because they sold the mushrooms with the steak they served to J.<br /><br /> Therefore D is a proper defendant.<br /><br /> <b>4. Actual cause</b><br /><br /> Supra<br /><br /> Here D is the actual cause of J's harm because but/for them [sic] serving the mushrooms J would not have been harmed.<br /><br /> <b>5. Proximate cause</b><br /><br /> Supra<br /><br /> Here D is the proximate cause of J's harm because contracting botulism is a foreseeable result of serving bad mushrooms.<br /><br /> <b>6. Damages</b><br /><br /> Supra<br /><br /> Here P suffered damages because he got sick and had to go the hospital.<br /><br /> <b>7. Defenses</b><br /><br /> Here there is no evidence that J was aware of the risk or that he was in any way negligent. Therefore D has no defense to J's claim of strict liability.<br /><br /> <b>B. Negligence</b><br /><br /> The discussion for negligence mirrors the discussion for strict liability in tort with the exception that negligence requires a showing of breach while strict liability does not.<br /><br /> <b>1. Breach</b><br /><br /> Supra<br /><br /> Here the burden of preventing the harm would have been to not disregard the notice they received warning of the danger.<br /><br /> Here there is no social utility in not reading the notice.<br /><br /> Here the likelihood of harm is high because Acme told them it was.<br /><br /> Here the magnitude of potential harm is high because botulism is a serious illness requiring hospitalization.<br /><br /> Therefore D breached their duty to J and is liable for negligence.<br /><br /> <b>C. Warranty</b><br /><br /> Under tort law all products carry with them an implied warranty of merchantability that they are fit for their intended use.<br /><br /> Here mushrooms are intended to be used as food.<br /><br /> Here the mushrooms were not fit for use as food because they caused botulism.<br /><br /> Therefore D breached the implied warranty of merchantability.<br /><br /> <b>3. Carl v. Dell (C v. D)</b><br /><br /> <b>A. Strict liability</b><br /><br /> Under tort law defendants are strictly liable for harm caused by wild animals or domestic animals who are known to be dangerous.<br /><br /> Here there is an animal known to be dangerous because it is reasonable to find that a large guard dog kept chained in a fence to keep out trespassers would be a danger to anyone he encountered.<br /><br /> Therefore D is strictly liable to C for the damage done by the guard dog.<br /><br /> <b>B. Actual cause</b><br /><br /> Supra<br /><br /> Here but/for the guard dog C would not have climbed the fence and fell, breaking his leg.<br /><br /> Therefore D is an actual cause of C's harm.<br /><br /> <b>C. Proximate cause</b><br /><br /> Supra<br /><br /> Here it is not unforeseeable that if a dangerous dog attacked someone they would try to get away and get injured in the attempt.<br /><br /> Therefore D is the proximate cause of C's harm.<br /><br /> <b>D. Damages</b><br /><br /> Supra<br /><br /> Here C is injured because he broke his leg.<br /><br /> Therefore C suffered compensable injuries.<br /><br /> <b>E. Defenses</b><br /><br /> Here there is no evidence that C was aware of the risk because he did not see the dog and it was asleep when he entered the bin. There is also no evidence that C was in any way negligent.<br /><br /> Therefore D has no defense to C's claim of strict liability.<br /><br /> <b>2. Negligence</b><br /><br /> Here as discussed above D can be found to be negligent in regards to C if it is found that he owed a duty and breached that duty to C.<br /><br /> <b>A. Duty</b><br /><br /> Supra<br /><br /> Landowners owe a duty to invitees to warn of hidden dangers on the property. Here C can be found to be an invitee because he was on the property to incur a benefit to D, the removal of the garbage.<br /><br /> <b>B. Breach</b><br /><br /> Supra<br /><br /> Here D breached the duty to C because they did not warn of the dangerous dog on the property.<br /><br /> <b>C. Actual cause</b><br /><br /> Supra<br /><br /> <b>D. Proximate cause</b><br /><br /> Supra<br /><br /> <b>E. Damages</b><br /><br /> Supra<br /><br /> <b>F. Defenses</b><br /><br /> Supra",
				"<b>1. Peter v. Dell's</b><br /><br /> Peter may be able to recover damages against Dell's for his injuries if he is able to prove the elements of negligence. In order to prevail in a negligence suit, Peter would have to show that Dell's had a duty of care to him which they breached, causing him damages.<br /><br /> <b>Duty:</b> A person ordinarily owes a duty of care to control their own conduct to prevent injury to other people that may result from the things they do. The duty owed may be based on statute, contract, relationship, admission of the duty, or creation of the peril. In this case, duty based on relationship is the important factor.<br /><br /> Here, the relationship between Peter and Dell's is important. Peter has gone onto the property of Dell's to use the restroom, even though Dell's has posted signs that indicate the restrooms are for customers only. Dell's may want to consider Peter a trespasser, and thus owed no duty. However, it is reasonably foreseeable that persons may come in off the street to use the facilities; if this were not so, then Dell's would not have posted the sign restricting access to their customers only. Peter is still not a licensee or invitee in this case, but because his trespass is either expected or common, Dell's owes a duty of care to him to warn of artificial hazards and to correct those that can be reasonably fixed.<br /><br /> Therefore, Dell's owes a duty of care to Peter.<br /><br /> <b>Breach:</b> A person has breached their duty of care when their conduct does not rise to the level required to protect others.<br /><br /> Here, Dell's could have replaced the bulbs making the bathroom area so very dark. Under the Hand analysis, if the burden of the precaution is less than the magnitude of the injury times its probability, then a breach has occurred. The burden of replacing a light bulb is small, as is the placing of a sign or notice that there are steps ahead. On the other side of the equation, the probability that someone will trip on the steps in the dark is great, and the magnitude of the possible injury is also great.<br /><br /> Therefore, Dell's has breached its duty of care to Peter.<br /><br /> <b>Causation:</b> In order to be liable, the defendant's conduct must be both the actual and proximate cause of the plaintiff's injury.<br /><br /> Actual cause is found when the defendant's conduct is the but-for cause of the injury, or in some cases a substantial factor in the injury.<br /><br /> Here, since the burned out light and lack of warning led directly to Peter's injury, Dell's breach of duty if [sic] the actual cause of the harm.<br /><br /> Proximate cause is found when there are no superseding, intervening events.<br /><br /> Here, there are no events intervening between Peter's entry into the restroom area and his accident due to the lack of lighting and signs.<br /><br /> Therefore, Dell's breach of its duty will be found to be the actual and proximate cause of Peter's injury.<br /><br /> <b>Damages: </b>In order to prevail, the plaintiff must show damages.<br /><br /> Here, the facts state that Peter suffered severe cuts and bruises from his fall.<br /><br /> <b>Defenses:</b> Dell's may have some defenses to this action. Defenses include contributory negligence (if the jurisdiction follows contributory negligence), comparative negligence, and assumption of the risk. In contributory negligence, if the plaintiff has any fault in the injury he suffered, then he is barred from recovery. In a comparative negligence jurisdiction, the plaintiff may recover according to the degree of fault assigned to the parties. In pure comparative negligence, he will recover his portion of damages, regardless of how small or large it may be. In modified comparative negligence jurisdictions, he will recover if his fault is 50% or less of the total fault. Under assumption of the risk, Peter would be barred from recovery if it was found that he knew of the risk and voluntarily engaged in the conduct anyway.<br /><br /> In this case, Dell's may assert that by walking into a dark, unfamiliar room, Peter contributed to his own injury. This would create a degree of fault for Peter. There may be some contributory or comparative negligence found here. Since Peter was unaware that there were steps that could harm him, assumption of the risk would not apply here. Result: In a contributory negligence jurisdiction, Peter would be barred from recovery based on walking into a dark unfamiliar room. In a comparative negligence jurisdiction, he would recover according to the degree of fault he was assigned by the court.<br /><br /> <b>2. John v. Dell's</b><br /><br /> John may have a cause of action against Dell's under strict liability in tort if he can show that he is a proper party, that the product was defective, that the product caused him harm, and he suffered damages.<br /><br /> Parties? Proper parties to a suit such as this must be foreseeable users of the product. In this case, John was a patron of a restaurant serving canned mushrooms which were defective and made him ill. A restaurant customer is a foreseeable user of food supplied to that restaurant.<br /><br /> Therefore, John is a proper party to sue in strict liability.<br /><br /> <b>Defective product?</b> The product must be shown to be defective either in design, manufacture, or warnings.<br /><br /> Here, the product was produced improperly and could cause botulism. The factory promptly notified its customers of the problem and offered to replace the mushrooms. Clearly they knew that the product was defective. The question is whether Dell's knew of the defect. The facts state that Dell's received the notice but disregarded it.<br /><br /> Therefore, the product is clearly defective in manufacture, and the parties involved were aware of the defect.<br /><br /> Was Dell's conduct the actual and proximate cause of John's harm? As discussed above, Dell's conduct must be shown to be both actual and proximate cause of the harm to John.<br /><br /> Here, Dell's knew of the potential for botulism poisoning from the mushrooms, because they were warned of the possibility, but they chose to ignore the warning and serve the mushrooms anyway. This conduct clearly cause [sic] the mushrooms to be served to John, causing him illness. There were no other intervening or possible sources of the harm to John.<br /><br /> Therefore, Dell's conduct in serving the mushrooms is the actual and proximate cause of John's injury.<br /><br /> <b>Damages?</b> John must show that he suffered some harm due to the actions of Dell's. Here, the facts state that John suffered five days of illness and hospital treatments. Therefore, John suffered damages from Dell's conduct in serving the mushrooms. Defenses? In strict liability in tort, there are no provisions for contributory negligence. Dell's would only be able to try to claim that either John knew there was a risk of poisoned mushrooms and ate them anyway, or that he was somehow at fault in eating them. Neither possibility seems likely.<br /><br /> Conclusion: Dell's will be found liable in strict liability in tort for the illness and damages John suffered due to eating the mushrooms.<br /><br /> <b>3. Carl v. Dell's</b><br /><br /> Carl may be able to recover damages from Dell's in strict liability due to his injuries from Dell's guard dog if he can show that Dell's knew that the dog had dangerous or vicious propensities to harm people. He would also have to show causation and harm in order to collect.<br /><br /> A person may be held strictly liable for the actions of domestic animals if the animal has a propensity to be vicious. If the dog has bitten before, or been trained to be vicious, then the owner is strictly liable without fault for any damage the dog may do to others. Here, the facts do not state if Dell's dog has actually ever bitten anyone. However, the facts do state that he is a guard dog, that it is chained up to keep trespassers out, and that [it] is kept in back near the trash bins. All these factors would seem to indicate that the dog is expected to be quite fierce and protective of the property, and may indeed demonstrate a degree of viciousness.<br /><br /> Therefore, by having such an animal, even chained up, Dell assumes the liability of any injuries the dog may inflict.<br /><br /> <b>Causation?</b> Discussed above. Actual and proximate cause required.<br /><br /> Here, the threat of the dog caused Carl to climb the fence from which he fell and broke his leg. The dog was the actual cause of the injury. In addition, Dell's fence was obviously high enough that falling from it, escaping from the dog, was sufficient to cause harm. Therefore, Dell's is the actual and proximate cause of Carl's injury.<br /><br /> <b>Damages?</b> Carl must show actual injury.<br /><br /> Here, the dog only damaged Carl's shoe. However, in the effort to escape from the dog, Carl climbed a fence, falling and breaking his leg. The shoe is only minor damage, but the broken leg is much more serious.<br /><br /> Therefore, Carl's damages including his damaged shoe and broken leg will be found to be injuries caused by the dog threat.<br /><br /> <b>Defenses?</b><br /><br /> There are none.<br /><br /> Result?<br /><br /> Dell's is liable for Carl's damages."

				"<b>Penelope v. Deals Department Stores [\"Deals\"]</b><br /><br /> <b>Negligence:</b><br /><br /> Negligence is a breach of a legal duty that actually and proximately causes damages to another.<br /><br /> <b>Duty:</b><br /><br /> A duty is what a reasonable prudent person would be required to do or not do under the same or similar circumstances.<br /><br /> Landowners owe no duty to trespassers but do owe a duty of care to persons they invite onto their land.<br /><br /> <b>Invitee:</b><br /><br /> An invitee is a person invited onto the landowner[']s premises for monetary exchange type of business tran[s]actions. A landowner owes the duty to inspect the premises for hidden defects that may pose a danger to the invitee and also owes a duty to repair any defects on the property.<br /><br /> The facts indicate that Penelope and her friends went shopping at Deals. This is a business exchange and therefore she is an invitee. Deal[s] owes her a duty of care as mentioned above.<br /><br /> <b>Breach:</b> A breach is the failure to perform a legal duty.<br /><br /> <b>Res Ipsa Loquitor</b><br /><br /> \"The thing speaks for itself.\" When an elevator door opens without the elevator present, it can be said that something went wrong and a breach occurred. The elevator was within Deals['] ability to fix and when this accident occurred the court can imply that he failed to inspect the elevator properly and place the burden on him to prove otherwise. Deal[s] has breached his duty of care.<br /><br /> <b>Causation:</b><br /><br /> <b>Actual Causation:</b><br /><br /> This is the sine qua non or - \"but for\" cause of the accident. \"But for\" the elevator not being properly maintained, this accident would have never occurred.<br /><br /> <b>Proximate Causation:</b> This is the direct or indirect act that caused the accident. Penelope will argue that her injury was a direct result from Deals' breach. She'll claim that there were not any intervening, unforeseeable or independent acts.<br /><br /> Deals will argue that Penelope's not looking as she entered was an intervening act since it occurred after his breach and was unforeseeable.<br /><br /> Deals['] act \"set the stage\" for the accident and was therefore an indirect proximate cause. Penelope's not looking is foreseeable since a blind person shopping at Deals was foreseeable as falling as well.<br /><br /> Deals' breach was an actual and proximate cause of Penelope's injuries.<br /><br /> <b>Damages:</b><br /><br /> For negligence, economic loss alone is not sufficient. One must suffer physical damages.<br /><br /> The facts indicated that Penelope sustained \"minor physical injuries as a result of her fall.\" These are sufficient damages.<br /><br /> <b>Result:</b><br /><br /> Deal[s] was negligent and will be liable for general and special damages for Penelope[']s injuries as a result of the fall.<br /><br /> <b>Aggrivated [sic] injuries: thin-skin Plaintiff.</b><br /><br /> The courts have established that the defendant is liable for even unforeseeable injuries that result due to the plaintiff's pre-existing weaknesses. Deal[s] will be liable for the acute psychotic breakdown that caused her permanent disabilities; even though it was unforeseeable and unpredictable at the time of the accident. Penelope can recover general and special damages for her physical disabilities that resulted due to Deals' negligence.<br /><br /> <b>Penelope v. Reliable Elevator Co. \"Reliable\"</b><br /><br /> <b>Products Liability - Negligence</b><br /><br /> <b>Duty:</b> Manufacturers of products owe a duty of care to provide safe products.<br /><br /> Under common law, Penelope would not be in privity of contract and not have the ability to sue Reliable.<br /><br /> However, modernly, MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co. established that manufacturers owe a duty of care to the purchaser and any foreseeable end user.<br /><br /> The facts indicate that Reliable \"manufactured and installed the elevator.\" Since they installed and even maintained it inside Deals Department Store, they were directly put on notice that any of Deals' employees or customers were foreseeable users of the product. Penelope as a customer thus has a cause of action since she is owed a duty of care.<br /><br /> <b>Breach:</b><br /><br /> <b>Res Ipsa Loquitor </b>(supra)<br /><br /> Since Reliable was to maintain the product and it failed to operate correctly, a presumption of a breach can be made. Reliable has breached its duty to Penelope.<br /><br /> <b>Causation: </b>(supra)<br /><br /> Actual cause can be shown since \"but for\" it not being properly maintained and inspected, the injury would not have occurred.<br /><br /> Proximate cause can be shown since there was no unforeseeable, intervening or independent act that broke the chain of causation.<br /><br /> <b>Damages:</b> (supra)<br /><br /> Penelope has suffered minor physical injuries and a permanent disability. Reliable will be liable for general and special damages for both due to their negligence.<br /><br /> Due to this not being a newly manufactured good strict liability & warrantee [sic] do not apply since any maintenance to the machine would be an alteration of modification of the product.<br /><br /> <b>DEFENSES</b><br /><br /> <b>Penelope v. Deal & Penelope v. Reliable</b><br /><br /> <b>Contributory Negligence:</b><br /><br /> Reliable and Deal[s] will argue that by Penelope stepping backwards into the elevator shaft without looking was her contributory negligence that should eliminate or reduce his [sic] liability.<br /><br /> Under common law, a person had to be 100% not negligent to collect. A person's even 1% contributory negligence barred them from any recovery.<br /><br /> Some courts offer \"Last Clear Chance\" for plaintiffs to eliminate there [sic] contributory negligence. But here, Penelope is not blind and she had the \"Last Clear Chance\" to avoid her injury simply by looking where she was going.<br /><br /> Under common law, Penelope would not collect for her injuries form Reliable or Deal[s].<br /><br /> Modernly, courts follow <b>comparative negligence</b>. In strict comparative negligence, Penelope can recover 1% of her damage even if 99% at fault. In other juri[s]dictions, they require that the plaintiff be no greater at fault[,] either 50-50% or 49-51%. Under these jurisdictions, Penelope can collect whatever portion she was not a[t] fault for. <b>Assumptions of the Risk.</b><br /><br /> Plaintiff must know and recognize the danger and proceed anyhow.<br /><br /> Here, Penelope's back was turned. It can be assumed that she wouldn't have stepped if she had seen the empty elevator shaft.<br /><br /> Penelope did not assume the risk.<br /><br /> <b>Deal[s] v. Reliable</b><br /><br /> Deal[s] may attempt to sue Reliable for indemnity.<br /><br /> Deal[s] will claim that since he contracted with Reliable to maintain the elevator that they were responsible to maintain it properly.<br /><br /> Deal[s] will state that he is not responsible as respondeat superior for Reliable since he is not their employer. They can maintain it when they want and can send whatever repairman they want. Thus, they are independent contractors.<br /><br /> Unless Reliable has an indemnity clause in their service contract, Deal[s] can sue them and collect for whatever amount that he had to pay Penelope.",
				"<b>Penelope vs. Deals</b><br /><br /> <b>Negligence</b><br /><br /> Penelope will bring an action for negligence against Deals.<br /><br /> <b>Duty</b> - Deals owes a duty to Penelope as a landowner occupier. Deals['] duty is to inspect, warn or make safe any dangerous conditions. This duty is imposed on Deals at this standard because Penelope is considered an invitee. An invitee is one who has consent to enter the landowners['] property and has a pecuniary interest in common with the owner.<br /><br /> <b>Breach</b> - A breach of the duty occurs when the defendant's actions fall below the standard of care owed.<br /><br /> Here the facts tell us that the elevator doors opened without the elevator being present. The defendant['s] failure to inspect the elevator and make it safe breached his duty to Penelope.<br /><br /> Deals could have had ensured by inspecting and placing warning signs to always look before stepping into the elevator.<br /><br /> <b>Causation</b><br /><br /> The defendant will be liable for an injury if he was both the actual and proximate cause of the injury.<br /><br /> <b>Actual Cause</b> - This test is usually referred to as the \"but for\" test. It can be said that but for Deals['] failure to inspect or make their premises safe, the injury would not have occurred.<br /><br /> <b>Proximate Cause</b> - This test is usually referred to as the foreseeability test. It is foreseeable that an elevator may[,] for whatever reason, not to [sic] be in position. Deals will counter that Penelope's act of not looking, before she stepped backwards, is an independent, unforeseeable, intervening act, but this arguement [sic] will fail, because it is foreseeable that a customer will be talking with friends and upon hearing the door open step in without looking.<br /><br /> Deals is therefore the proximate cause of the injuries.<br /><br /> <b>Damages</b> - The plaintiff must actually suffer damages to recover for negligence. This does not appear to be an issue, because the facts tell us she was injured.<br /><br /> <b>Contributory Negligence</b> - As stated as a defense to proximate causation Deals will counter that when Penelope didn't look, before stepping, she contributed to her injury. If this is found to be true she will be barred under a contributory jurisdiction from recovery. A comparative jurisdiction will allow her to recover, with an offset due to [t]he percentage at fault, under a pure[-]comparative. Under a partial comparative, she may recover if she wasn't found more than 50% at fault.<br /><br /> As stated prior this arguement [sic] will fail and Deals will be liable for negligence. It should be noted that Deals may be able to obtain indemnity from Reliable. If one does not find negligence as stated supra, res ipsa loquitor discussed infra can be applied here.<br /><br /> <b>Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress</b><br /><br /> The defendant can recover under this theory if she was within the zone of danger, and suffered severe emotional distress.<br /><br /> Since she actually suffered injury due to the negligence, she was in the zone of danger. Also, the facts tell us, she suffered [an] acute psychotic breakdown that is permanent, which will satisfy the element of severe emotional distress and the impact requirement of some jurisdictions.<br /><br /> Deals will counter that he should not be liable because the plaintiff already had a preexisting condition, but this will fail, because you take your plaintiffs as you find them. His attempt to break causation will fail, because he was the actual and proximate as discussed supra.<br /><br /> Deal[s] liable for negligent infliction.<br /><br /> <b>Penelope vs. Reliable</b><br /><br /> Penelope will sue Reliable under a products liability theory.<br /><br /> A manufacturer can be held liable under negligence, warranty and strict liability if their product was defective and caused the injury.<br /><br /> <b>Negligence</b> A manufacturer is held liable for any injury caused to a foreseeable end user or bystander, due to his negligent design, manufacturing or failure to provid[e] adequate warning.<br /><br /> The case of MacPherson vs. Buick no longer requires privity.<br /><br /> <b>Res Ipsa Loquitor</b><br /><br /> The facts tell us that this type of accident has never occurred and that there is no evidence of what caused the elevator to be out of position.<br /><br /> When there is no evidence to support a negligent act, res ipsa loquitor is used. âThe accident must be of the kind that does not normally occur absent negligence. Here an elevator doesn't fail to reach it's [sic] destination absent some negligence. ãAlso, the cause of the injury must be in the exclusive control of the defendant. Here Reliable was not only the manufacturer, but also responsible for maintaining the product. It will therefore be deemed to have been in his exclusive control.<br /><br /> Reliable may counter that he was not in exclusive control, because Deals would also be in control. This arguement [sic] will fail because, as stated, Reliable was responsible for maintaining also.<br /><br /> The final element is that the plaintiff did not cause or contribute to the injury. Although Reliable will state that Penelope did cause and contribute to the injury, as discussed in P v. Deals, this arguement [sic] will fail.<br /><br /> Therefore Reliable will be found liable, under res ipsa, but it should be noted that this is just an inference of negligence, to be decided by a jury.<br /><br /> <b>Warranty</b><br /><br /> A manufacturer's products come with a warranty of merchantability that they will be safe when used for ordinary purposes. Under Henningson vs. Bloomfield, no privity is required.<br /><br /> Here the facts tell us the elevator failed to appear when the door opened. An elevator is suppose[d] to be there, therefore it failed to meet it's [sic] ordinary purpose. Since it did not appear as discussed infra it was the actual and proximate cause and damages resulted.<br /><br /> <b>Strict Liability</b> A manufacturer is held strictly liable for any injuries caused to any foreseeable end user or bystander, as a result of a defective product.<br /><br /> Under Elmore vs. American Motors no privity is required.<br /><br /> There are no facts to indicate that there was a design, manufacturing or warning defect."

			"essay": "Spacetrip is a new venture created to send paying clients on a trip of a lifetime to the moon aboard its spaceship, the Escapade. This spaceship is equipped with a vehicle escape system using parachutes to allow passengers to return safely to the ground should a malfunction occur during the spaceship's ascent. This system is widely used and listed in the Rocket Industry Standards Manual as being \"sufficient to provide adequate safeguards.\"<br /><br />Recently, a new system has become available that uses rockets to navigate the escape capsule back to the ground much more safely. However, this new system is also much more expensive than the parachute system and has not been tested in real-life situations. Spacetrip decided to stick with its tried-and-true parachute system.<br /><br />Paula, who wanted an adventure, decided to purchase this trip from Spacetrip. She signed a contract containing this statement: \"Although Spacetrip has taken all reasonable measures to provide a safe voyage, I understand that space exploration is dangerous.\"<br /><br />On the day of the liftoff, the weather was beautiful and all systems were working as designed. But shortly after takeoff, a totally unpredictable violent storm arose, blowing the Escapade off course. There was no way to correct for the deviation, so Spacetrip activated the escape system, which deployed as designed. Unfortunately, the storm caused the escape capsule to crash to the ground. Paula was critically injured, but survived. Investigations after the accident indicated that the new rocket escape system might have led to a better outcome.<br /><br />1. What tort cause(s) of action may Paula reasonably bring against Spacetrip? Discuss.<br /><br />2. What defense(s), if any, does Spacetrip have? Discuss.",
			"sampleAnswers": [
				"<strong>1) Paula v. Spacetrip:</strong><br /> <br /> Negligence:<br /><br /> Negligence is the failure to behave with the level of care that someone of ordinary prudence would have exercised under the same conditions. In order for the plaintiff to prove a prima facie case of negligence, the plaintiff must prove that the defendant owed her a duty, that the defendant breached that duty, that the breach of that duty was both the actual and proximate cause of her injury/damages.<br /><br /> <strong>(1) Duty:</strong><br /> <br /> Duty is a legal duty requiring the defendant to conform his conduct to a certain standard of care in order to protect the plaintiff from unreasonable risks of harm. A defendant owes a duty to all foreseeable plaintiffs and the extent of that duty is determined by the applicable standard of care. Under the majority Cardozo view, a plaintiff is foreseeable if he/she is in the zone of danger. Under the minority view, Andrews, everyone is a foreseeable plaintiff.<br /><br /> A defendant owes a duty to exercise reasonable care to foreseeable plaintiffs. Here, Paula (P) is a foreseeable plaintiff that is within the zone of danger because she is a customer of Spacetrip (S) who is using the service provided by S, going to the moon. Seeing that P is a customer, P is an invitee of S. P is an invitee because she is on S's premises, the spaceship, for a business purpose, to go to the moon, in which P is paying S for. As an invitee, S owes P a duty to inspect for unknown concealed dangers and to warn of them or to make the dangerous condition safe. Furthermore, S has a duty to exercise reasonable care for activities conducted on the property.<br /><br /> Here, S owes P a duty of reasonable care in order to prevent unreasonable risks of harm because P is an invitee.<br /> <strong><br /> (2) Breach of Duty:</strong><br /> <br /> A breach of duty occurs where the defendant fails to act or conform his conduct to the applicable standard of care. A breach of duty can be proven under the Learned Hand Formula and by the Res Ipsa Loquitur test.<br /><br /> <strong>Learned Hand Formula:</strong><br /> <br /> Under the Learned Hand Formula, a breach of a duty owed by the defendant can be established if the burden of taking a precaution is less than the probability of the harm occurring the gravity of the likely harm.<br /><br /> Here, under the Learned Hand Formula, P can establish that S breached its duty because there is an adequate precaution that S could have taken in order to prevent an injury from occurring. There is a new system that has become available that uses rockets to navigate the escape capsules on the spaceship back to the ground in a much more safe way. Here the burden of taking the precaution is that the extra precaution is more expensive than the system that S is already using, the parachute system. However, the burden of taking the extra precaution is less than the probability of the harm occurring. The probability of the harm occurring may not be relatively high, but the probability of the harm occurring is likely high enough because a newer and safer safety system was developed for this exact purpose. The magnitude of the harm occurring is serious because the failure of a product to function properly and the failure to exercise reasonable care in a safety precaution can result in severe damage to the body and even death. Here the resulting harm that could occur from not taking the precaution and using the new system is outweighed by the magnitude of the harm that can occur, especially since investigators stated the use of new rocket escape system might have led to a better outcome.<br /><br /> <strong>Conclusion:</strong><br /> <br /> P can establish that S breached its duty to exercise reasonable care by failing to use the safer alternative escape capsule. Res Ipsa Loquitur:<br /><br /> Under the Res Ipsa Loquitur test, a breach of a duty can be established if there is no direct evidence demonstrating what happened, the event causing the plaintiff's injury is one that would normally not occur in the absence of negligence by someone, and the instrument was under the exclusive control of the defendant at the time the accident occurred.<br /><br /> Here, there is direct evidence showing that the capsule malfunctioned due to the storm. The facts state that the capsule deployed and the storm was the cause of P's harm.<br /><br /> <strong>Conclusion:</strong><br /> <br /> Under the Res Ipsa approach P will likely fail to establish a breach.<br /><br /> <strong>(3) Causation:</strong><br /> <br /> Causation is the link that links the defendant's conduct to the plaintiff's injury. The plaintiff must prove that the defendant was both the actual cause and the proximate cause.<br /><br /> <strong>Actual Cause:</strong><br /> <br /> The defendant is the actual cause of plaintiff's injury if, but for the defendant's failure to exercise reasonable care, the plaintiff would not have suffered injury.<br /><br /> Here P will argue that, but for S not using the new rocket escape capsule system, P would not have suffered an injury. This can further be demonstrated by the fact that investigators stated that the use of new rocket escape system might have led to a better outcome.<br /><br /> <strong>Conclusion:</strong><br /> <br /> S is the actual cause of P's injury.<br /><br /> <strong>Proximate Cause:</strong><br /> <br /> Is the philosophical connection that limits liability to consequences that bear some reasonable connection with the defendant's conduct. Here, P can establish that S is the proximate cause of her injuries because the fact that S failed to take the extra precaution and use the new system, it is foreseeable that an accident of this type can occur. The accident that occurred that caused harm to P is clearly foreseeable based on the fact that there was a new escape capsule being developed that would be safer. It is foreseeable that if S failed to take this precaution then an injury of the type might occur.<br /><br /> S will likely argue that the storm was a superseding cause of plaintiff's injury because it was an act of god.<br /><br /> However, S will likely not prevail on this argument because while, yes, a severe storm is an act of god, it is foreseeable that a storm could occur at any moment, and that a storm could affect the way in which a capsule returns to earth and is foreseeable that the failure to take reasonable precautions would result in damage to a foreseeable plaintiff, consequently, that is P.<br /><br /> <strong>Conclusion:</strong><br /> <br /> P can establish that S's failure to use the new capsule is the proximate cause of her death.<br /><br /> <strong>(4) Damages:</strong><br /> <br /> Plaintiff must suffer actual injury.<br /><br /> Here the plaintiff suffered severe injury and is critically injured.<br /><br /> <strong>Main Conclusion:</strong><br /> <br /> P will succeed on a claim of negligence.<br /><br /> <strong>Strictly Liability:</strong><br /> <br /> Is liability for injuries regardless of culpability or fault.<br /><br /> <strong>Abnormally Dangerous Activity:</strong><br /> <br /> A defendant is liable for all injuries that result while engaging in an abnormally dangerous activity so long as the harm suffered is a result of the risk that makes activity dangerous in the first place and the injury was suffered in a foreseeable manner.<br /><br /> Here, the activity of taking passengers to space would be abnormally dangerous because it creates a great risk of harm, the likely harm is serious because it could result in death, the activity is not one of common usage, or appropriate to the community and the risk of the activity outweighs the benefit of the activity to the community.<br /><br /> Here, the likely harm that can be suffered from this activity, death, the activity creates a great risk of death because the activity takes people to the moon and back. This is not common to the community because people do not normally go to the moon and back. Therefore, the risk of harm posed by the activity outweighs the benefit of the activity to the community. Here the harm suffered is the type of harm that is likely to occur from engaging in such an activity because S is traveling to the moon and back which is risky and can cause serious injury. Furthermore, the harm was suffered in a foreseeable manner because it is foreseeable that a storm may occur.<br /><br /> <strong>Conclusion:</strong><br /> <br /> S will be strictly liable because the activity is abnormally dangerous.<br /><br /> <strong>Products Liability:</strong><br /> <br /> A seller or distributor will be strictly liable for any harms that occur from a defective product. Plaintiff must prove that the defendant is a merchant, that there was a defective product, causation, and intended or foreseeable misuse.<br /><br /> <strong>Defendant is a Merchant:</strong><br /> <br /> A merchant is one that ordinarily sells or distributes the goods of the kind.<br /><br /> Here, S is a merchant of the Escapade, the escape capsule, because S normally deals with the good, and he sells trips to individuals who desire to go to the moon. This fact makes S a merchant because he normally deals in the goods of the type and S is one that normally uses the product.<br /><br /> <strong>Defective Product:</strong><br /> <br /> P must prove that the product was defective. A product can be defective because of a manufacture defect, a design defect, or because the defendant failed to give adequate warning of a non obvious risk.<br /><br /> <strong>Manufacture Defect:</strong><br /> <br /> A manufacture defect occurs where the product deviates from the norm of products produced by the manufacturer in a way that makes the product more dangerous even though all care was exercised in manufacturing and marketing the product.<br /><br /> Here, the Escapade is a single product that was struck by a storm. According to the facts, the product deployed properly. However, the product can have a manufacture defect because the product was not able to withstand the storm and the product failed to return P safely to earth. Therefore, the product failed to function properly.<br /><br /> <strong>Design Defect:</strong><br /> <br /> Occurs where all products bear the same feature whose design is defective and abnormally dangerous. There are two tests used, the consumer expectation test and the benefit risk test.<br /> <strong><br /> Consumer Expectation Test:</strong><br /> <br /> Under the consumer expectation test, P can demonstrate that the product failed to perform as an ordinary consumer would expect it to. Here, the rocket failed to return P back to earth safely. Therefore, the product failed to perform as safely as an ordinary consumer would expect it to because an ordinary consumer would expect to be returned back to earth safely.<br /><br /> <strong>Risk Benefit Test:</strong><br /> <br /> P must prove that the defendant could have made a safer product without impacting the price and utility of the product.<br /><br /> Here, P can show that S could have used a safer product, i.e. the new escape capsule. This product is safer and would be a safer alternative to the one that S currently uses.<br /> <strong><br /> Causation:</strong><br /> <br /> Here, S is the actual cause because, but for S not using the alternative, P would not have suffered harm. S is also the proximate cause because it is foreseeable that a product whose design is faulty, would cause injury to another.<br /> <strong><br /> Intended Use or Reasonably Foreseeable Misuse:</strong><br /> <br /> A defendant is liable if the product was used as intended.<br /><br /> Here the Escapade was used as intended. The Escapade was used to return passengers to earth in the event that an accident occurred. Here, the Escapade was used when a storm struck the spaceship and the Escapade failed to function properly<br /><br /> <strong>Main Conclusion:</strong><br /> <br /> P will likely succeed on claim against S for strict products liability.<br /><br /> <strong>Warranties:</strong><br /> <br /> <strong>Express Warranty:</strong><br /> <br /> An express warranty occurs where the seller of a product, a merchant, states that the product will function in proper way, or function how the model will function.<br /><br /> Here, there is a breach of express warranty because the escape capsule failed to function properly and failed to perform \"sufficient to provide adequate safeguards\" upon returning the earth from the moon.<br /><br /> <strong>2) Defense:</strong><br /> <br /> <strong>Contributory Negligence:</strong><br /> <br /> If P is found at all negligent, then she will be barred from recovery.<br /><br /> Here, P was not negligent, therefore, she will not be barred from recovery under contributory negligence.<br /><br /> <strong>Comparative Negligence:</strong><br /> <br /> If P is found to be at all negligent, then P's recovery will be reduced by the percentage that the court applied for her negligence. Here, P was not negligent in causing her injuries. Therefore, she will receive recovery under both the modified and pure negligence theories. Assumption of the Risk:<br /><br /> Occurs where the plaintiff voluntarily, and unreasonably proceeds in the face of a known risk created by the defendant's negligence. Here, S would argue that P impliedly assumed the risk because she voluntarily proceeded in the face of a known danger created by the risk of the activity that S offers.<br /><br /> <strong>Conclusion:</strong><br /> <br /> Here, it is likely that S will succeed on a claim for implied assumption of the risk because P knew of the danger posed by the venture and P voluntarily proceeded in the face of that danger.<br /><br />",
				"<strong> Paula v Spacetrip</strong><br /> <br /> <strong>Negligence</strong><br /> <br /> Negligence is the failure to exercise the degree of care that a reasonably prudent person would under similar circumstances. To recover, Plaintiff must show duty, breach of duty, causation, damages and that there are no defenses.<br /><br /> <strong>Duty</strong><br /> <br /> A defendant owes a duty of care to foreseeable plaintiffs to act as a reasonably prudent person would under similar circumstances. Under Cardozo, (majority) the duty is owed to those in the zone of danger. Under Andrews (minority) the duty is owed to foreseeable plaintiffs. Here, Spacetrip owed Paula the duty to act as a reasonably prudent carrier would under similar circumstances.<br /><br /> Spacetrip as a common carrier would also owe Paula an elevated duty of care as a passenger on their spaceship. They would have a duty to make sure that they were prepared for any emergency and if those emergencies did occur, that they would protect Paula.<br /><br /> They owe her a duty to take all precautions for a safe trip and to bring her home safely.<br /><br /> <strong>Breach of Duty</strong><br /> <br /> A defendant breaches their duty when they fail to live up to the standard of care. To decide if they have breached their standard of care, we use two tests: the Learned Hand risk utility analysis and the consumer expectation test.<br /><br /> Learned Hand Risk Utility Analysis<br /><br /> Under this test, if B < PL then the defendant has breached their duty to the plaintiff. B is equal to the burden of prevention, P is equal to the Probability of harm and L is equal to the magnitude of harm.<br /><br /> Here, the Burden of Prevention is the cost of the new vehicle escape system that has become widely available to navigate the escape capsule back to the ground more safely. This system is much more expensive than the parachute system and has not been tested. Paula will argue that Spacetrip should have used the new system as it was much safer. Spacetrip will counter argue that the new system was not only not tested, it was very expensive.<br /><br /> The Burden of Prevention here is therefore very high.<br /><br /> The Probability of Harm is unclear; however it would seem reasonable that any trip to outer space would encounter dangers as we have seen in the past. Spacetrip is also a new venture and therefore would not have the experience that a longer term business would have. It would seem that the probability of harm would be high.<br /><br /> The Magnitude of Harm here would be very high. An accident in space would be magnified by the challenges of rescue and the inherent dangers of traveling in space. Even with what they call a tried and true rescue system, the new venture may not know how to react to risky situations. Therefore, any accident would seem highly likely to result in great harm or death.<br /><br /> Spacetrip also had no other back up system in case they had a mistake. All of their eggs were in one basket so to speak. That makes the magnitude of serious harm more likely. Therefore, the magnitude of harm is very high.<br /><br /> Balancing all of these factors it would seem that Spacetrip breached their duty to Paula by not investing in the new system that would have navigated the escape capsule back to the ground more safely and by not having a back up system.<br /><br /> <strong>Consumer Expectation Test</strong><br /> <br /> The consumer expectation test tells us if there has been a breach of duty when a reasonable consumer's expectations are not met.<br /><br /> Here, Paula has purchased a trip to the moon aboard the Escapade. She has a reasonable expectation of safe travel even in a new venture to both get there safely and return safely. A reasonable person would have similar expectations.<br /><br /> Spacetrip fails the consumer expectation test as they did not meet the expectations.<br /><br /> Spacetrip will argue here that the system they have installed is \"tried and true\" and that the vehicle escape system they used is widely used and listed in the Rocket Industry Standards Manual as being sufficient to provide adequate safeguards. They will claim that the new system has not been tested in real life situations. They will say because of this they have not breached any duty. However, because of the elevated duty they have to Paula to keep her safe on her travels they should have invested in the safest system available at the time. Going into space is inherently dangerous and carries enormous risks, and they should have been prepared to face those risks with the latest and safest technology. Due to Learned Hand and the consumer expectation test, Spacetrip has breached their duty to Paula.<br /><br /> <strong>Actual Cause</strong><br /> <br /> Actual Cause can be tested by the \"but for\" test, where but for their action, the harm would not have occurred.<br /><br /> Here, But for Spacetrip's crash to the ground Paula would not have been harmed.<br /><br /> Spacetrip is the actual cause of Paula's harm.<br /><br /> <strong>Proximate Cause</strong><br /> <br /> Proximate Cause is the natural and foreseeable result of one's actions with no superseding intervening causes to break the chain of causation. Here, Spaceship will argue that there were intervening, superseding causes that break the chain of causation. They will argue that the weather was beautiful when the ship took off and there was a totally unpredictable violent storm that blew the Escapade off course. However, it is foreseeable that when one is traveling that weather conditions can be unpredictable so that will not break the chain of causation. Spacetrip is the proximate cause of Paula's injury.<br /> <strong><br /> Damages</strong><br /> <br /> General and Special damages for medical expenses and pain and suffering.<br /><br /> Here, if Paula is considered not to have assumed the risks of space travel, she will be able to collect for the expenses she has occurred as a result of the crash.<br /><br /> <strong>Defenses</strong><br /> <br /> <strong>Contributory Negligence</strong><br /> <br /> In a contributory negligence jurisdiction, where the plaintiff negligently contributes to his own harm, the plaintiff's recovery is barred. Here, there is no indication it is a contributory negligence jurisdiction or that Paula has negligently contributed to her own harm. This will not be a defense.<br /><br /> <strong>Comparative Negligence</strong><br /> <br /> In a comparative negligence jurisdiction, the plaintiff contributes negligently to his own harm, and his recovery is reduced by the percentage of his negligence. In a modified jurisdiction, if his negligence is over 50%, his recovery is barred.<br /><br /> Here, there is no indication that Paula has contributed to her own harm.<br /><br /> This will not be a defense.<br /><br /> <strong>Assumption of the Risk</strong><br /> <br /> When the plaintiff assumes the risks, expressly or impliedly, and they do it knowingly and voluntarily, their recovery may be barred. Here, Paula signed the contract. It expressly said, \"Although Spacetrip has taken precautions, I understand that space exploration is dangerous.\" By signing this, Paula is agreeing that she is undertaking significant risks in the actions she is taking. It is understood here, that Space presents unique challenges and that by going there she is agreeing to assume the risks of those challenges.<br /><br /> Because Paula assumed the risk of space travel, she will not be able to recover.<br /><br /> <strong>Strict Product Liability</strong><br /> <br /> Where a defective product causes injury, the manufacturer, retailer, and distributor are strictly liable for any injuries that occur. To recover, plaintiff must show that they are a proper plaintiff, suing a proper defendant, that the product is defective, causation and damages.<br /><br /> <strong>Proper Plaintiff</strong><br /> <br /> A proper plaintiff is any foreseeable plaintiff, including users and bystanders, as privity is not required.<br /><br /> Paula is a user so she is a proper plaintiff.<br /> <strong><br /> Proper defendant</strong><br /> <br /> A proper defendant is a manufacturer, retailer, distributor or wholesaler.<br /><br /> Spacecraft is the manufacturer of the spaceship.<br /><br /> They are a proper defendant.<br /><br /> <strong>Defective Product</strong><br /> <br /> A product is defective if it has a design defect, a manufacturing defect, or a warning defect.<br /> <strong><br /> Design Defect</strong><br /> <br /> A product has a design defect if it could have been designed safer without destroying the products commercial utility.<br /><br /> Here, the Escapade has been designed with the old safety system. The old safety system does not bring the escape pod to the ground as safely. We use the risk utility analysis to decide if the product can be designed safer.<br /><br /> <strong>Risk/Utility analysis - Supra</strong><br /> <br /> Here, we can see that the product has been designed safer. The new system navigates rockets back to the earth more safely. There is a design defect.<br /><br /> <strong>Consumer Expectation Test</strong> - Rule and analysis - Supra<br /> <br /> This product does not meet the expectations of a reasonable consumer.<br /><br /> There is a design defect.<br /><br /> <strong>Actual Cause</strong> - Rule and Analysis - Supra<br /> <strong><br /> Proximate Cause </strong>- Rule and Analysis - Supra<br /> <strong><br /> Defenses</strong><br /> <br /> State of the art<br /><br /> Here, Spacetrip will claim that they have the most recent \"safest\" product as the new one has not been tested. They will also argue that they use what is listed in the Rocket Industry Standards and this is what is required.<br /><br /> However the new product is known to be safer, so this will not be a defense.<br /><br /> <strong>Damages</strong> - Rule and Analysis - Supra"

			"essay": "On a sunny winter day, Dan went for a hike in the mountains. While walking on a trail far from civilization, a sudden storm arose. Thick snow accompanied by horrific winds created blizzard conditions. Dan was an experienced outdoorsman and knew that, without shelter, he was likely to succumb to hypothermia and die.<br /><br />Fortunately, Dan remembered that his friend Jill owned a cabin in the vicinity. Jill had told him that he could use the cabin should the need arise. In the blizzard conditions, Dan struggled to find Jill's cabin, but soon saw a red-roofed log cabin that looked exactly like Jill's. As promised, the key was under the mat, and Dan entered to wait out the storm. In order to stay warm, Dan removed some built-in wooden bookshelves from the wall and used them to build a fire in the fireplace. He also threw in some books that were on the shelves to keep the fire going. He slept in front of the fire, and the storm was over the following morning.<br /><br />Before leaving the cabin, Dan wrote Jill a note thanking her for the use of the cabin and apologizing for the missing shelves. He forgot to mention the books. He left his phone number and told her to give him a call.<br /><br />As it turns out, the cabin where Dan stayed was owned by Polly and not Jill. When Polly went to the cabin to open it for the summer, she noticed that her bookshelves and books were missing and found a note on the table from some fellow named Dan.<br /><br />Polly was outraged that a stranger would use her cabin without her permission, destroy the bookshelves, and take her books.

				"<strong>POLLY v. DAN</strong><br /> <strong><br /> TRESPASS TO LAND</strong><br /> <br /> The intentional and volitional entry onto the real property of another person with possessory rights that causes damages. It interferes with the exclusive possession of the land.<br /><br /> Here, Dan enters onto the land of Polly. The land does not belong to Dan, nor does Dan have any ownership interest in the land. Polly will argue that Dan was not authorized to enter the land. Polly will also say that just because she was not present and using her land/cabin at the time of Dan's arrival, that Dan had the right to enter the land or the cabin.<br /><br /> Thus, Dan has committed Trespass to Land.<br /><br /> <strong>DEFENSES</strong><br /> <br /> <strong>PRIVATE NECESSITY</strong><br /> <br /> When there is an emergency situation, a person may enter the land of another to avoid extreme physical harm or injury, but they are still liable for damages.<br /><br /> Here, Dan is hiking in the wilderness. Dan sees that there is a bad storm coming. There are thick snow and blizzard conditions. Dan realizes that he would likely die if he does not find shelter. Dan will likely be seen as \"authorized\" to enter the land of Polly because his life was in danger. However, Polly can sue for damages and recover for any harm caused.<br /><br /> This defense will be successful. However, Polly can recover damages discussed infra.<br /><br /> <strong>CONSENT<br /> </strong><br /> When there is adequate and authorized permission, there is consent.<br /><br /> Here, Dan believes that he is entering his friend's cabin, and not the cabin of Polly. Dan has the express consent to enter the land and cabin of his friend. However, Dan requires the consent of Polly, and not the consent of his friend.<br /><br /> This defense will likely fail.<br /><br /> <strong>MISTAKE</strong><br /> <br /> When the actual circumstances of the situation are different than one has surmised, there is a mistake. Dan has mistakenly entered into the land of Polly with the belief that the property actually belongs to his friend. Dan has mistaken the red-roof of his friends cabin for Polly's cabin.<br /><br /> Dan will say that there was a key under the mat, just as he expected. This is the exact behavior that his friend Jill does. This will not serve as a defense to the intentional tort of trespass to land. Mistake is not a defense for this intentional tort. TRESPASS TO CHATTELS<br /><br /> The intentional and volitional interference with the possession or use of property of another that causes damages. Dan used Polly's stationery to write a letter. The stationery (paper and pen) did not belong to Dan. Dan interfered with Polly's right to use her belongings for other purposes. However, this worked out well for Polly because Dan identified himself and left his phone number, making him easy to contact and identify if Polly wanted to seek recovery.<br /><br /> Dan has committed trespass to chattels.<br /><br /> <strong>DEFENSES</strong><br /> <br /> None available for this tort.<br /><br /> <strong>CONVERSION OF BOOKS AND WOOD SHELVES</strong><br /> <br /> The intentional and substantial interference with the personal property of another that is so great that it is treated as a forced sale. The remedy is typically the fair market value of the goods at the time and the place of the conversion.<br /><br /> Here, Dan \"burned\" some of the book shelves in the fireplace in order to stay warm. He also burned some of the books. Property that is completely burned cannot be recovered. The interference of Polly's property possession is \"substantial\" because it is completely destroyed.<br /><br /> This is a conversion.<br /> <strong><br /> DEFENSES TO CONVERSION</strong><br /> <br /> <strong>IMPLIED CONSENT</strong><br /> <br /> Dan will argue that his friend would have allowed him to burn whatever was necessary for him to burn in order to stay warm and not die from the cold blizzard.<br /><br /> This argument will likely fail because the consent of Polly was required - not the consent of his friend. Polly did not allow him to destroy her property.<br /><br /> Thus, no implied consent.<br /> <strong><br /> NECESSITY</strong><br /> <br /> Again, Dan will argue that it was necessary for him to start a fire. He will say that he used the most reasonable materials available - wood and books. He will further state that he would have died from hypothermia without a fire.<br /><br /> This argument will succeed, however damages are recoverable, discussed below.<br /><br /> <strong>DAMAGES</strong><br /> <br /> <strong>NOMINAL DAMAGES FOR TRESPASS TO LAND</strong><br /> <br /> The land was not harmed. Nominal damages (perhaps $1.00) to show that a wrong has occurred will likely be available.<br /><br /> <strong>FAIR MARKET VALUE FOR THE BOOKS AND SHELF WOOD</strong><br /> <br /> There was a conversion (discussed supra). Polly can recover the fair market value of the wood for the shelves, as well as the books that were destroyed.<br /><br /> <strong>GENERAL DAMAGES</strong><br /> <br /> Polly can recover for the emotional harm she suffered when she thought that her cabin was broken into. If there was pain and suffering involved, she can recover monetary damages for that pain and suffering.<br /><br /> <strong>SPECIAL DAMAGES</strong><br /> <br /> Polly can recover the reasonable cost of any other economic harm that she suffered. Since Dan used her stationery to write a letter, she can recover for that. She can also likely recover for having the cabin sufficiently cleaned. Further, she can recover the reasonable value of the cost to re-install the shelves into the cabin.<br /><br /> <strong>PUNITIVE DAMAGES NOT AVAILABLE</strong><br /> <br /> Where there are intentional torts, punitive damages may be available to punish the defendant.<br /><br /> Here, Dan was not acting with malice - he was simply trying to stay alive and survive a brutal snow storm. He was not acting with intent to harm - only to stay alive and survive. Polly may argue that he did not inform her of the books that he burned, and that his omission of that fact was malicious. This argument will fail. There is clearly no malice. Thus, punitive damages will not be available.",
				"<strong>Polly v. Dan</strong><br /> <br /> <strong>1. Polly's Claims against Dan</strong><br /> <br /> <strong>Trespass to Land</strong><br /> <br /> Trespass to land is the intentional invasion of the land of another without consent or privilege.<br /><br /> Here, the facts state that Dan took the key under the mat at the cabin and \"entered to wait out the storm,\" and he remained in the cabin until leaving the following morning. Thus, Dan's entering Polly's cabin was an intentional invasion, and because the cabin actually belonged to Polly, Dan's entering was into the cabin was thus on the land of another, Polly's. Dan will argue that he did have consent from Jill to enter her cabin, which appeared virtually identical to Polly's, and thus his entering Polly's cabin was based on a reasonable mistake.<br /><br /> However, mistake as to land ownership is not a recognized defense, as it is the intentional invasion of the land itself which constitutes the tort of trespass.<br /><br /> Here, Dan intended to invade Polly's land, and so Polly will have a claim against Dan for trespass to land, absent a privilege that Dan might have to enter the land (infra).<br /><br /> <strong>Trespass to Chattel</strong><br /> <br /> Trespass to Chattel is the intentional interference with the personal property of another without consent or privilege.<br /><br /> The facts state that inside Polly's cabin Dan had \"removed some built-in wooden bookshelves from the wall and used them to build a fire in the fireplace\" in order to stay warm during the blizzard. Dan also \"threw in some books\" that were on the shelves to keep the fire going.<br /><br /> Because Dan removed the wooden bookshelves and threw in the books for the purpose of making a fire to stay warm, his acts were volitional and so he intended to interfere with these items. Since the books and the bookshelves belonged to Polly, Dan interfered with the personal property of another.<br /><br /> Dan will argue that he had implied consent to interfere with these items from Jill, who told Dan he \"could use the cabin should the need arise.\" However, mistake as to the ownership of the property is not a recognized defense, even if in good faith.<br /><br /> Here, Dan intended to interfere with personal property which belonged to Polly, so Polly will have a claim against Dan for trespass to land, absent a privilege that Dan might raise to interfering with the property.<br /><br /> <strong>Conversion</strong><br /> <br /> Conversion is intentional interference with the personal property of another which is so substantial as to warrant requiring the converter to pay for the full value of the property converted.<br /><br /> Dan intentionally interfered with the personal property of another, Polly, supra.<br /><br /> Polly will argue that the use of her property amounted to conversion. Since Dan had \"removed some built-in\" wooden bookshelves from \"the wall\" of the cabin and threw them into the fireplace, Dan clearly converted the bookshelves as they are now destroyed forever, depriving Polly of their substantial use and value. Moreover, while the facts do not state this, depending upon Dan's removal of the bookshelves from the wall, Dan may have caused substantial damage to portions of the wall.<br /><br /> Polly will further argue that Dan took her books without permission, and so converted the books as well because by taking them he substantially deprived Polly of their use.<br /><br /> Dan will argue that he did not take the books with him but used them, like the bookshelves, for stoking the fire. However, this is not much of a counter argument as Dan still destroyed the books, depriving Polly substantially of their use and value.<br /><br /> Dan's use of the wooden bookshelves and the books for keeping the fire burning destroyed these items, and so his intentional interference with Polly's personal property is substantial enough to warrant requiring Dan to pay for the full value of the property converted, discussed infra. 2. Dan's Defenses<br /><br /> <strong>Consent<br /> </strong><br /> As discussed supra, because Dan obtained consent only from Jill and not from Polly--the actual owner of the land and possessor of the property at issue--then Dan has no valid consent from the owner, Polly, to enter her land or use her property.<br /><br /> Dan has no valid consent.<br /><br /> <strong>Mistake</strong><br /> <br /> Reasonable, good faith mistakes do not serve as a defense to trespass to chattels, trespass to land, or conversion.<br /><br /> Dan's reasonable mistake as to ownership, even though in good faith, still will not serve as a defense to Polly's claims for damages.<br /> <strong><br /> Private Necessity</strong><br /> <br /> Private Necessity operates as an incomplete defense to trespass to land and trespass to chattel/conversion, and arises when circumstances such as natural disasters render conditions so unsafe and involving risk of great harm or death that there is a privilege to trespass upon and use land and chattels belonging to another if reasonably necessary to avoid harm to oneself. One who trespasses upon property/chattels out of a private necessity is still liable for any damages/harm caused while on the land or while using the chattels.<br /><br /> Because Dan was located \"far from civilization\" when a \"sudden\" storm arose, Dan will argue that he had a private necessity to trespass upon Polly's land for the purpose of finding shelter and escaping the \"horrific winds\" and the blizzard conditions outside, as he knew that such conditions would likely expose him to hypothermia and death. As such, Dan had a privilege to trespass upon Polly's land to avoid great imminent harm to himself from the blizzard.<br /><br /> Moreover, because blizzards create very cold conditions, Dan's using the books and bookshelves inside the cabin in order to build a fireplace was reasonably done out of a necessity to stay warm. Dan had a privilege to trespass upon Polly's chattels to avoid great harm to himself from potential hypothermia.<br /><br /> Dan will not be liable for trespass to chattels, conversion, or for trespass upon Polly's land due to his privileged entry and privileged use of Polly's land and personal property due to his private necessity. However, because private necessity is an incomplete defense, Dan may still be liable for damages caused by his use of land and/or property during the course of the private necessity, infra.<br /><br /> <strong>3. Damages Recoverable by Polly from Dan</strong><br /> <strong><br /> Damage to Books</strong><br /> <br /> Damages/harm caused during the course of a private necessity are recoverable.<br /><br /> Because Dan destroyed the books to build the fireplace, the books were converted and Dan is thus liable to pay for their full value, or a \"forced sale.\"<br /><br /> <strong>Damage to Bookshelves</strong><br /> <br /> Damages/harm caused during the course of a private necessity are recoverable.<br /><br /> Because Dan destroyed the bookshelves to build the fireplace, the bookshelves were converted and Dan is thus liable to pay for their full value, or a \"forced sale.\"<br /><br /> <strong>Damages for Use of Polly's Land</strong><br /> <br /> Damages/harm caused during the course of a private necessity are recoverable.<br /><br /> Because Dan was only on the land to ride out the storm and left immediately once the storm subsided the next morning, his privileged invasion of Polly's land lasted only so long as the private necessity created by the storm existed, and so because he left when his private necessity was no longer present the next morning, Polly will not recover damages for Dan's trespass upon her land."
