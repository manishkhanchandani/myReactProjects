			"essay": "Craft Village is a small town that is popular with tourists because of its fine arts and crafts stores. Craft Village has no public transportation. All of the stores are located on Main Street. There is one large gallery, Northwoods Gallery, at the north end of Main Street. At the south end of Main Street is the Snooze Inn, a large motel. Tourists often stay at the Snooze Inn when they want to spend more than a day in Craft Village. Craft Village shops, by town ordinance, must remain open from at least 10:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. every day, including Sundays. All of the shops close at 8:00 p.m. except Northwoods Gallery, which is open until 11:00 p.m. every night. Craft Village provides street lighting along Main Street, which is turned on each night at dusk.<br /><br />Jean arrived in Craft Village on Sunday night for her annual shopping expedition. As on all of her previous trips to Craft Village, she stayed at the Snooze Inn for two nights. She does not own a car, and one of the reasons she likes Craft Village is that she can walk to all the shops.<br /><br />Jean got up on Monday morning to go shopping. She shopped all day, and walked back to the Snooze Inn at 7:00 p.m. for dinner. After dinner, at around 8:30 p.m., she began walking to Northwoods Gallery. Half way there, she was accosted by a mugger. The mugger stood in front of her and shouted, \"Hand over your purse, or I'll beat you up!\" The mugger roughly snatched Jean's purse as she held it out to him. The mugger fled, and Jean turned around and ran back to the Snooze Inn. The mugger was later captured by the police.<br /><br />On what theory or theories, if any, might Jean recover damages from, and what defenses might she anticipate, in an action against: <br /><br />1. The mugger? Discuss. <br /><br />2. Craft Village? Discuss. <br /><br />3. Northwoods Gallery? Discuss. <br /><br />4. Snooze Inn? Discuss.",

				"<b>Jean v. Mugger</b><br /><br /><b>Assault</b><br /><br />The intentional placing of another in reasonable apprehension of an immediate harm without consent or justification.<br /><br />When the mugger shouted at Jean to \"Hand over your purse, or I'll beat you up,\" his conduct was volitional and therefore intentional.<br /><br />Mere words are not adequate to cause apprehension. The words \"hand over your purse or I'll beat you up\" coupled with the fact that he had the present ability to carry the threat out indicates the placing of another in reasonable apprehension.<br /><br />In addition, Jean held out the purse indicating that she was apprehensive. It does not seem that Mugger had consent or justification.<br /><br />Therefore, Mugger is liable for assault.<br /><br /><b>Battery</b><br /><br />Battery is harmful or offensive touching of another without consent or justification.<br /><br />When Mugger roughly snatched Jean's purse from her he touched an item that was intimate to Jean's person, which was offensive.<br /><br />Therefore, there was a touching of another. There is not consent due to the fact Jean held her purse out because she was afraid and no justification.<br /><br />Therefore Mugger is liable for battery.<br /><br /><b>TRESPASS TO CHATTEL</b><br /><br />Trespass to chattel is the interference with the personal property of another.<br /><br />When Mugger roughly snatched Jean's purse and fled he interfered with the personal property, a purse, which belonged to Jean. Jean gave no consent and Mugger was not justified in his behavior.<br /><br />Thus, Mugger is liable for trespass to chattel. <br /><br />Jean may recover damages caused by the interference.<br /><br /><b>CONVERSION</b><br /><br />Conversion is the intentional exercise of dominion and control over the personal property of another.<br /><br />When Mugger snatched Jean's purse and fled he exercised dominion and control over Jean's personal property contrary to Jean's possessory rights.<br /><br />Therefore, Mugger is liable for conversion. Jean may recover for damages for the cost of the purse including value of the purse in a forced sale or reasonable rental value if returned, plus damages.<br /><br /><b>Jean v. Craft Village</b><br /><br /><b>Negligence</b><br /><br />Craft Village may be liable to Jean for damage if it is found that Craft Village owed a duty to Jean, that they breached their duty, which was the actual and proximate cause of Jean's injuries.<br /><br /><b>DUTY - GENERAL DUTY</b><br /><br />As a small town Craft Village owes a duty of due care not to subject visitors of the town to unreasonable harm as a reasonable small town in the same or similar circumstances.<br /><br />It may be argued that because Craft Village was a small town, with no public transportation, popular with tourists and all stores located on one main street that they owed a duty of care to the patrons of the village to make the streets safe. Especially in light of the fact the city required the stores to remain open until 8:00 p.m. which could be considered past dark and more inviting for crime.<br /><br /> Jean was a foreseeable plaintiff in that she was a tourist of the village out shopping. Therefore, Craft Village owed a duty.<br /><br /><b>SPECIAL DUTY - LAND OCCUPIER</b><br /><br />As a small town, Craft Village is the occupier of the city street, including Main Street. Jean will argue that Jean is an invitee because she was on the street for the purpose it was open to the public. Thus, Craft Village owed a duty to inspect, discover, warn or correct any harm.<br /><br />Even if Jean is determined to be a licensee Craft would owe a duty to warn or make safe any known harm.<br /><br />The facts do not indicate that Craft Village was aware of or had reason to inspect for any incidents of crime. There is no special duty owed.<br /><br /><b>BREACH</b><br /><br />Under the general duty of making the streets safe given the circumstances it may be argued that because it is such a small town with a large concentration of tourists in one location and keeping the business open after dark it is reasonable to provide adequate protection by police or security on Main Street. Especially because there is no public transport.<br /><br />Therefore, by failing to provide security, Craft Village breached its duty.<br /><br /><b>Causation</b><br /><br /><b>Actual cause</b><br /><br />But for failure to provide protection, Jean would not have been harmed.<br /><br /><b>Proximate Cause</b><br /><br />It is foreseeable given the above mentioned circumstances that a tourist like Jean would be mugged. Mugger is intervening force but Craft made crime more likely to occur. <br /><br />Thus, Craft Village is the proximate cause.<br /><br /><b>Damages</b><br /><br />General damages for pain and suffering. Special damages for loss of purse.<br /><br /><b>Defenses</b><br /><br /><b>Contributory Negligence</b><br /><br />Conduct which falls below the standard of care for one's own protection.<br /><br />Craft Village will argue that Jean went out on her own and did not protect herself. However, no facts indicate Jean's conduct contributed to her own injury. Not a valid defense.<br /><br /><b>Assumption of Risk</b><br /><br />A party assumes the risk if he knowingly undertakes an activity with full knowledge of the risk. <br /><br />No facts indicate Jean knew the risk of a robbery occurring. Assumption of risk is an invalid defense.<br /><br /><b>Immunity</b><br /><br />As a city, Craft Village will seek immunity. However, the act of maintain[ing] Main Street was proprietary in nature and not immune.<br /><br /><b>Jean v. Northwood Gallery (Northwoods)</b><br /><br /><b>Negligence</b><br /><br />Defined supra.<br /><br /><b>Duty</b><br /><br />Special duty - As a store owner Northwoods owed a duty to all its invitee patrons to inspect, discover and warn of any angers. However, Jean was not a patron or even on Northwoods' property.<br /><br /> Therefore, there is no duty owed to Jean.<br /><br /><b>General Duty</b><br /><br />Not to subject patrons to unreasonable harm. Northwoods owes no general duty because Jean was not patron.<br /><br /><b>Jean v. Snooze Inn (Snooze)</b><br /><br /><b>Negligence</b><br /><br />Defined supra.<br /><br /><b>Duty as an innkeeper</b>, Snooze owes a higher standard of care, including to protect guests from harm and partake in a course of conduct which causes the least harm. <br /><br />Jean was a guest and therefore a duty was owed.<br /><br /><b>Breach</b><br /><br />By failing to provide protection or some type of shuttle service for its guests, Snooze's actions were below the standard of care of a reasonable innkeeper in the same or similar circumstances. Especially given the concentration of tourists which increases the likelihood of crime. Thus Snooze breached its duty of care to Jean.<br /><br /><b>Causation</b><br /><br /><b>Actual Cause</b><br /><br />But for Snooze's failure to adequately protect Jean, Jean would not have been robbed.<br /><br />Snooze is the actual cause.<br /><br /><b>Proximate Cause</b><br /><br />It is foreseeable that it being after hours and in a tourist area that a person will be robbed. Snooze will claim Mugger's actions were an intervening force. However, Mugger's conduct was the type of harm they were obligated to protect against, thus not superceding.<br /><br />Thus, Snooze is the proximate cause.<br /><br /><b>Damages</b><br /><br />As discussed under negligence of Craft Village. Jean is entitled to general and special damages.<br /><br /><b>Defenses</b><br /><br /><b>Contributory Negligence</b><br /><br />This will fail as discussed above.<br /><br /><b>Assumption of Risk</b><br /><br />This will fail as discussed above.<br /><br /><b>Indemnity</b><br /><br />If Snooze is found secondarily liable then they may seek indemnity from Craft Village.<br /><br /><b>Contribution</b><br /><br />Joint tortfeasor may seek reimbursement from other tortfeasor. <br /><br />Craft Village and Snooze may file for contribution against each other.",
				"<b>Jean v. Mugger</b><br /><br /><b>1. Issue - Is Mugger Liable to Jean for Tortious Assault?</b><br /><br />Under common law, assault is the voluntary act with intent to place another in immediate apprehension of a battery (harmful/or offensive contact). Here Mugger, expressly \"threatened\" Jean by saying, \"Hand over your purse or I'll beat you up.\" This express threat is sufficient and of which Jean was aware to cause a reasonable person in immediate apprehension of being beat up (harmful/offensive contact). Therefore Mugger will be liable to Jean for assault.<br /><br /><b>2. Issue - Is Mugger liable to Jean for Tortious Battery?</b><br /><br />Under common law, battery is the voluntary act with intent to cause harmful/offensive contact and does cause such contact. Here, Mugger used his threat to obtain the purse. Because Jean actually held her purse out to him, rather than him taking it by force (no harmful/offensive contact occurred), Mugger will probably not be liable for battery.<br /><br /><b>3. Issue - Is Mugger liable to Jean for Conversion?</b><br /><br />Conversion is the unreasonable interference with another person's chattel to sufficiently dispossess them of it. Here, Mugger's interference is the crime of robbery (Trespassory taking and carrying away of personal property of another with the intent to permanently deprive for the person/presence of through the use of force or fear). Because his words and actions expressed that he intended to take and keep the purse, which he in fact did, Mugger will be liable to Jean for conversion.<br /><br /><b>Jean v. Craft Village</b><br /><br /><b>4. Issue - Can Craft Village be liable to Jean for negligence?</b><br /><br />Negligence is the failure to use due care that a reasonable person would use in the same or similar circumstances. A prima facie case of negligence requires the showing of the elements of duty, breach, actual and proximate cause and damages.<br /><br /><b>5. Did Craft Village owe Jean a Duty?</b><br /><br />Under common law, the duty owed is that of reasonable or due care under most situations where there is a duty owed. Normally there is no duty to strangers, absent a special relationship or statute. Where duty is owed by relationship, varying standards of care may be imposed depending on the nature of the relationship. Here, at minimum, the town is required to use due care in the protection of their citizens and visitors.<br /><br /><b>6. Did Craft Village owe Jean a higher standard of duty?</b><br /><br />Craft Village is a town [in] which streets are open to the public. Jean's status as a public invitee (licensee) requires that the town exercise a higher standard of care. The standard required is to warn of known dangers. If the town knew or should have known they had a problem with crime, they have a duty to warn/repair.<br /><br /><b>7. Did Craft Village breach their duty?</b><br /><br />Breach occurs when the defendant fails to use reasonable care. Here, the town provided street lighting which may be viewed as a reasonable care to deter crimes which often happen in the dark, such as robbery. The town also required all businesses to remain open until 8:00, that could be to ensure that there are a lot of people around during \"core\" hours, which provides another level of protection from crime. However, if Craft knew or should have know they had a crime problem, and these security features they've employed (lights, hours) are not sufficiently reasonable to mitigate the threat of crime, they may be found to have breached their duty. Absent their knowledge of the crime, Craft will not be found to have breached.<br /><br /><b>8. Was Craft Village actions the legal/proximate cause?</b><br /><br />Unless it can be found that Craft Village failed to act reasonably in the protections it provided, the town itself is not the legal or proximate cause of Jean's mugging, the mugger is. Therefore the town will not be held responsible.<br /><br /><b>Jean v. Northwoods</b><br /><br /><b>9. Issue - Can Northwoods be liable to Jean in negligence?</b><br /><br />Negligence and its elements are discussed above. Northwoods may owe a duty to its customers to discover and repair all known dangers. Here, Jean only made it halfway to the store, so she wasn't on the premises. However, Northwoods is the only store that stays open until 11:00 pm at night. Therefore if it can be found that Northwoods' late hours are not reasonable for the safety of its customers, they may owe a duty to warn its customers of potential dangers to include criminal activity in the area.<br /><br />ACTUAL CAUSE - is the \"cause in fact\" of the harm done. PROXIMATE CAUSE - is the legal scope of responsibility. Under Palsgraf, Cardozo asserted that one is responsible for those plaintiffs in the zone of danger, however, Andrews asserted a duty to one is a duty to all. Here, the Mugger is the \"But, for\" or cause in fact of Jean's mugging (Damages). However, if Northwoods' late hours are a substantial factor in her mugging (Jean wouldn't have been on the street after 8:00 because the other stores close then), and on the street to the store is sufficiently within the zone of danger, then Northwoods may be found to have had a duty which they breached.<br /><br /><b>Jean v. Snooze Inn</b><br /><br /><b>10. Can Snooze Inn be liable to Jean for negligence?</b><br /><br />Negligence (see supra). As an innkeeper, Snooze Inn owes a duty of care to its patrons. Jean was a patron of the hotel as she stayed overnight for two days. The standard of care of innkeepers is determined by a special relationship under which Jean was an invitee. Under this standard, the hotel will have a duty to warn of all known dangers, including a danger of criminal activity if they knew or should have known. Absent the knowing of this fact, Snooze Inn, there are no facts to show that Snooze failed to act reasonably. Therefore, they will not be liable to Jean for Negligence.<br /><br /><b>11. Does Northwoods/Snooze/Craft have a defense of assumption of the risk?</b><br /><br />Assumption of the risk is when a person knows and appreciates the nature of risks inherent to an activity and assumes that risk by voluntarily proceeding with the activity. Here, Jean, as a visitor, may not have known of the crime potential in the town. However, the fact that all but one of the stores close at 8:00 pm may be an indicator that the town does not want people on the streets after that time. The fact that Northwoods was open until later may negate that logic. If a reasonable person would not walk in the streets after 8:00 because of obvious dangers or risks (especially to a woman traveling alone), the business and hotel may be able to assert the defense of assumption of the risk. Assumption of the risk is a complete bar to the plaintiff's recovery.<br /><br /><b>12. Does Northwoods/Snooze/Craft have a defense of comparative negligence?</b><br /><br />At common law, a person has the responsibility to act reasonably for the protection of their own self. Here if Jean was not acting reasonably in walking alone, after dark, on an unoccupied street, the hotel/business may be able to assert comparative negligence which is a partial bar to recovery. Jean's recovery will be apportionately reduced by the percentage of fault attributed to her. In some jurisdictions, comparative fault is a complete bar, if the percentage of fault of the plaintiff is half or more (51%).<br /><br />"

			"essay": "A zoo maintenance employee threw a pile of used cleaning rags into a hot, enclosed room on the zoo's premises.

A zebra escaped from the zoo through the hole in the fence caused by the water.<br /><br /> A young child encountered the zebra in a nearby residential area. The child petted the zebra and offered it a stick of candy. In taking the candy from the child the zebra bit off one of the child's fingers.<br /><br /> On what theory or theories of liability might an action be brought against the zoo on behalf of the child and what should be the likely outcome of such action? Discuss.",
			"sampleAnswers": [
				"<b>I. Child vs. Zoo</b><br /><br /> <b>Strict Liability.</b> For the child to recover against zoo in strict liability she must simply show that the wild animal causing her injury was owned by or under the care of the zoo and that she suffered injury that were [sic] of the type consistent with foreseeable harm by the wild animal. This is because owners/caretakers of wild animals are strictly liable for the reasonable and foreseeable harm caused by the wild animal.<br /><br /> Here, the zebra was clearly under the care/control of the zoo when it escaped from its cage. As such, zoo would be strictly liable for any reasonable/foreseeable harm the animal causes.<br /><br /> Zoo will argue that the child assumed the risk when it petted the zebra and offered it a stick of candy. However, given the fact that the zebra is generally considered to be a wild animal, and that it is foreseeable that it could bite if in close proximity to a person, this would not relieve zoo's liability.<br /><br /> <b>II. Child vs. Zoo</b><br /><br /> <b>Negligence.</b> For child to recover against zoo in negligence, she must show duty, breach of that duty, causation, and damages.<br /><br /> [Note: Zoo's liability would be based on various liability under the theory of respondeat superior as the zoo's employer (Maintenance Man), and the performance of his duty, set into motion the series of events that resulted in child's injury.]<br /><br /> <b>Duty.</b> Duty arises when there is a legally recognized relationship between plaintiff and defendant that results in defendant having to act is [sic] some fashion other than arbitrarily towards plaintiff. The duty owed is one of reasonable care towards all foreseeable plaintiffs in the zone of danger created by defendant's negligence.<br /><br /> At common law, duty was largely based on one's status in relationship to defendant. One could be an invitee, a licensee, or a trespasser. Here the child plaintiff was not on defendant's property at the time of the accident, but rather was in a residential area \"nearby\" the zoo. As zoo is in the business of housing, caring for, and maintaining wild animals, it should be reasonably foreseeable that an accident could arise that would result in an animal being left loose in the nearby community, and because of the nature of a wild animal's behavior, harm could have resulted to a person in the nearby community. This is particularly true where children are around.<br /><br /> <b>Breach of Duty.</b> Breach of duty arises when defendant's actions do not rise to the standard of care required by the law. Here, Learned Hand's approach would note that the zoo breached its duty if the cost incurred with avoiding the harm causing incident was less than the product of the probability of the harm causing incident arising and the magnitude of loss should the harm causing event occur.<br /><br /> Here, a fire caused a large water main to break with the ensuing rush of water washing away a portion of the zebra's pen fence. When considering a pen fence, (as opposed to a sturdy cage), it's entirely foreseeable that a sudden deluge of water could wash away a portion of the \"fence.\" As such, the zoo should have ensured construction of a caged facility that would be sturdy enough to withstand this type of accident.<br /><br /> The cost involved with the construction of a pen of this nature would be significantly less than the potential danger that a wild animal could cause to men, women, and children in a nearby area should that animal escape. As such, it could be argued that the zoo breached its duty.<br /><br /> <b>Causation.</b> For liability to arise, the zoo (or in this case, the zoo's employee) would have to be both actual and primary cause of the child's injury.<br /><br /> <b>Actual Cause.</b> Actual cause arises when \"but for\" defendant's actions, plaintiff would not have been injured. Here, the zoo's maintenance employee threw a pile of cleaning rags saturated with a flammable cleaning fluid into a hot, enclosed room. The maintenance man should have known that there was the potential for the rags igniting resulting in a fire. When this happened, the fire set into motion a series of events that resulted in the zebra getting free and the child being bitten. As such, \"but for\" the maintenance man's action, the child's injury would not have occurred.<br /><br /> <b>Proximate Cause.</b> Arises when a result is the natur[al] and probable/reasonable and foreseeable consequences of defendant's actions. Here, we look to see if the injury is of the type reasonably expected, or was significantly more severe than reasonably expected. Here, there was a fire, that resulted in a water main bursting, that resulted in a fence being washed away, that led to a zebra escaping, that resulted in a child being bitten by the zebra. The zoo could reasonably argue that the type of injury resulting to the child was not of the type that would be the foreseeable natural consequence of a fire that caused a water main to break. As such, they could avoid liability as the maintenance man's actions would not be the proximate cause of the child's injury.<br /><br /> <b>Defenses.</b> At common law, contributing negligence was a complete bar to recovery. Here, the zoo could argue that the child was contributorily negligent when she petted the zebra and fed it candy. If the court argued, child would be barred from recovery.<br /><br /> <b>Comparative Fault. </b>Today, most jurisdictions have adopted comparative fault. Here, the could [sic] would weight [sic] the percentage of responsibility on each of the parties and assess damages accordingly. If child was less at fault than zoo, she could recover accordingly.<br /><br /> <b>Assumption of Risk.</b> If it can be shown that the child knew the consequences of her actions and knowingly embraced the danger, this could bar her from recovery. This would be a matter of fact for the court to decide.",
				"<b>Child v. Zoo</b><br /><br /> <b>Strict Liability</b><br /><br /> Owners of trespassing wild animals will be held strictly liable (no fault need be shown) for damages proximately caused by the animals.<br /><br /> <b>Zebra a Wild Animal?</b> A wild animal is one that is not domesticated (does not serve man). A zebra is a wild animal because its only use is to be displayed in a zoo. This zebra is from a zoo and thus is considered wild.<br /><br /> <b>Causation.</b><br /><br /> The damage to the child was both actually (BUT-FOR TEST) and proximately (LEGALLY) caused by the zebra because the zebra bit off the child's fingers [sic]. But for this biting, the child would not have lost his fingers [sic]. There are no superseding causes.<br /><br /> <b>Damages.</b> The child lost his fingers [sic].<br /><br /> <b>Defense.</b> Because contributory negligence is not a defense to strict liability, the only question is whether Child assumed the risk.<br /><br /> <b>ASSUMPTION OF RISK</b> requires plaintiff to understand the nature and extent of the risk and to disregard that risk. Here there is no evidence that Child apprehended a risk when approaching the Zebra. Indeed, Child's offer of candy was a friendly gesture that showed Child probably was comfortable and had no idea that his fingers were in danger.<br /><br /> Therefore Child did not assume the risk of injury.<br /><br /> <b>Domestic Animal?</b><br /><br /> Zoo could try to claim that, like a horse, a Zebra is a domestic animal, and as such, Zoo would not be strictly liable unless the zebra had known dangerous tendencies. However, this claim should be dismissed because a zebra only looks like a horse; they [sic] are not, however, domesticated.<br /><br /> Under the facts Child should be able to recover from Zoo in Strict Liability.<br /><br /> <b>Negligence?</b><br /><br /> Negligence is conduct that falls below the standard of care set by law to protect others from unreasonable risk of harm.<br /><br /> Here Child may also assert a claim in negligence if he can show that Zoo breached an owed duty to him, actually and proximately causing Child's damages.<br /><br /> <b>Vicarious Liability</b><br /><br /> Under the doctrine of RESPONDEAT SUPERIOR Zoo will be liable for torts committed by its employees if they act within the scope of their duties.<br /><br /> Here the maintenance employee was doing his duties, cleaning up, when he threw the rag into the hot room. Zoo will be liable for any tort arising from this act if it is tortious.<br /><br /> <b>Duty.</b><br /><br /> Zoo owes a duty to act as a reasonable zoo. In addition, as possessor of land, they owe a duty not to harm others outside their land by activities on the land.<br /><br /> <b>Breach.</b><br /><br /> Under Cardozo from the Palsgraf decision a duty is owed to all foreseeable plaintiffs, generally within the zone of the activity. Here it is foreseeable that an escaped Zebra would run into civilians and so Zoo was under a duty to be very careful this wouldn't happen.<br /><br /> Here Zoo breached this duty in possibly several ways.<br /><br /> 1. First, Child could argue that Zoo's employee was negligent in not realizing that a rag soaked with a flammable liquid could spontaneously combust in a hot enclosed room. This, however, is a poor argument because most maintenance men do not have that understanding of physics and chemistry.<br /><br /> 2. Second, Child could claim that Zoo did not build a strong enough fence to keep the zebras penned in. This is not so strong either because the force from the broken water main probably exceeded any natural force that could reasonably be foreseen. But if the fence was not strong for normal wear and tear Child could show breach here.<br /><br /> 3. A third argument, much better, is that Zoo has a duty to notice when wild animals escape and has ready plans to round them up or tranquilize them if they do escape. Here it seems Zoo did nothing while the zebra ran away. Therefore Zoo has breached its duty to control its animals.<br /><br /> <b>Causation.</b> Zoo might claim that the Child's offer of candy was superseding cause that breaks the chain of proximate causation. However, Child would have to be doing something independent and unforeseeable for Zoo to prevail. While carrying candy is not a response to an escaped zebra, it is not unforeseeable that a child should have candy, nor is it unforeseeable that such a child might offer it to the zebra.<br /><br /> <b>Damages.</b><br /><br /> Discussed supra.<br /><br /> <b>Defenses.</b><br /><br /> <b>CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE</b> is conduct by the plaintiff that fails to conform to the standard of care set by law for the plaintiff's own protection. Here a CHILD STANDARD OF CARE applies. Child will be expected to act as a reasonable child of similar age, experience, and education will act in similar circumstances.<br /><br /> Here Child's behavior is typical of a \"young child\" and is therefore not negligent.<br /><br /> <b>ASSUMPTION OF RISK</b> fails for the similar reason as discussed supra.<br /><br /> Therefore Child could also recover for his damages under Negligence theory."
