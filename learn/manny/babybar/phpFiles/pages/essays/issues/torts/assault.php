Certain elements must be present to prove an assault occurred: 1. The plaintiff <b>perceived immediate physical contact</b> with the defendant, 2. Plaintiff had suspicion that he was <b>in imminent danger</b>. 3. The <b>actions</b> of the defendant, or tortfeasor, <b>were intentional</b>, not accidental. <br><br>Assault is an <b>intentional tort</b> when one is placed in <b>reasonable apprehension</b> of an intentional, imminent, unconsented, harmful, or offensive touching by another person. Assaults occur when the targeted person's anxiety is the product of the actor's threatening conduct, such as stalking or placing a gun in front of one's face (loaded or not). As long as the individual has a reasonable apprehension of some offensive contact, an assault has occurred. </div></div><div class="panel panel-primary"><div class="panel-heading"><b>Sample Essay Format</b></div><div class="panel-body"><span>Here defendant acted <b>intentionally</b> because ... </span><span>Here defendant did / did not <b>Overt Act</b> because ... </span><span>Here there is <b>Reasonable Apprehension</b> because ... </span><span>Here there is Apprehension of <b>Immediate Battery</b> because ... </span></div><div class="panel-footer">Therefore, the defendant may be liable for tortious assault.</div></div><div class="panel panel-primary"><div class="panel-heading"><b>External Links</b></div><div class="panel-body"><ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQ6smN3lcnY&amp;list=PLpbtRdN7xWUd2Mjw1haKHAu_g81xK0v72" target="_blank">Torts Playlist</a></li></ul></div></div><div><div class="panel panel-primary"><div class="panel-heading"><b>Videos</b></div><div class="panel-body"><ul><li><a href="">Torts lecture: Assault | quimbee.coms</a></li><li><a href="">Episode 2.1: An Overview of Intentional Torts</a></li><li><a href="">The Law of Torts (in Hindi)</a></li><li><a href="">Torts Assault</a></li><li><a href="">Episode 1.1: What is Torts?

She shopped all day, and walked back to the Snooze Inn at 7:00 p.m. for dinner. After dinner, at around 8:30 p.m., she began walking to Northwoods Gallery. Half way there, she was accosted by a mugger. The mugger stood in front of her and shouted, "Hand over your purse, or I'll beat you up!" The mugger roughly snatched Jean's purse as she held it out to him.<div class="divider"><b>SOLUTION: </b></div><div class="divider">Under tort law, An ASSAULT is an <b>intentional overt act</b> which causes an <b>immediate apprehension</b> of a harmful or offensive contact. An act is intentional if it is done purposely knowingly that the results will follow.<br><br>Here mugger acted <b>intentionally</b> because mugger shouted at Jean to "Hand over your purse, or I'll beat you up," his conduct was volitional and therefore intentional. Here mugger did <b>Overt Act</b> because he took substantial step in shouting over Jean. Here there is <b>Reasonable Apprehension</b> because mere words alone are not adequate to cause apprehension. The words "hand over your purse or I'll beat you up" coupled with the fact that he had the present ability to carry the threat out indicates the placing of another in reasonable apprehension. Here there is Apprehension of <b>Immediate Battery</b> because mugger shouted "I'll beat you up" i.e. act of causing battery. <br><br>Therefore, Mugger is liable for assault.</div></li></ol></div></div><div class="panel panel-primary essays"><div class="panel-heading">Essays To Practice</div><div class="panel-body"><div>Click on each of the following hypo and try to write the essay related to "Assault" only in the following textarea.<br></div><ol><li><a href="">june 2002</a></li><li><a href="">june 2008</a></li></ol></div></div><div class="panel panel-primary mbe"><div class="panel-heading">MBE Ideas</div><div class="panel-body"><div>Click on each of the following Ideas and try to understand the idea related to "Assault".</div><ul><li><a href="">Idea 1: Imminent Bodily Contact</a></li><li><a href="">Idea 2: Reasonable Apprehension</a></li></ul></div></div><div><div class="quiz divider"><h3>Simple Quiz</h3><button type="button" class="form-control btn btn-primary">Start Simple Quiz</button></div></div></div><div class="col-md-4"><div><a href="">Show Past Essay Answer</a></div><div class="pastResults"><div><a href="">Show Past Quiz</a></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="row"><br><br><hr><br><div class="col-md-6"></div><div class="col-md-6"></div><br><br></div></div></div></div></div>
