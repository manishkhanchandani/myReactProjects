		Sample1: `GATES V. KENT
1) TORTIOUS ASSAULT?
Under tort law an assault is an intentional act to cause, and which does cause, reasonable apprehension of an immediate battery, a harmful or offensive touching. An act is intentional if it is for the purpose or with knowledge with reasonable certainty a result will occur.
Here Kent acted intentionally because he intended to pull a "prank" on Gates. His intent because it was a "prank" was to cause Gates to be "apprehensive". Gates was “apprehensive” and that was reasonable because he was held “hundreds of feet in the air”.
Therefore, Kent can be liable for assault.
2) TORTIOUS BATTERY on Gates?
Under tort law a battery is an intentional act done to cause a harmful or offensive touching.
Here Kent acted intentionally because he intended to pull a " prank", and he caused a touching because he “lifted and flew” Gates into the air. This would be an offensive touching to a reasonable person because it is socially offensive to be grabbed in this manner by a stranger.
Therefore, Kent can be liable for battery.
3) FALSE IMPRISONMENT?
Under tort law a false imprisonment is an intentional act causing the plaintiff to be confined to a defined space against their will with no reasonably apparent means of reasonable exit. The plaintiff must be aware of the confinement.
Here Kent intentionally acted because it was a “prank”, and he confined Gates with no reasonably apparent means of reasonable exit because he put him on a “ledge”. And Gates was aware of his confinement because he was "apprehensive" of falling and "taunted" by the crowd.
Kent may argue that Gates was not actually confined because all he had to do was go through the “window”. But that means of exit was not reasonably apparent because even the “firemen” who tried to get Gates down for “hours” did not realize discover it.
Therefore, Kent can be liable for false imprisonment.
4) INTENTIONAL INFLICTION OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS?
                   
Under tort law intentional infliction is an intentional, outrageous act causing the plaintiff severe emotional distress. Generally emotional distress will not be assumed, and the plaintiff must present evidence showing that they did, in fact, suffer severe emotional distress. Evidence of mere humiliation and embarrassment is generally not enough.
Here there was an intentional, outrageous act because Kent "flew" Gates to the top of a building and strand him there in front of a crowd where he was “taunted for hours”.
However there is no evidence Gates suffered severe emotional distress because the facts only state that he was "humiliated" and “embarrassed”.
Therefore, Kent can only be liable for IIED if Gates presents additional evidence of emotional distress.
WORLD TRIBUNE V. KENT 5) TRESPASS TO LAND?
Under tort law a trespass to land is an intentional act causing unauthorized entry onto, under or over the land of another. The entry may be by the defendant personally or by some person or object directed or placed on the land by the defendant. When an object is placed on the land it constitutes a “continuing trespass.” No damage is necessary, but the defendant is liable for all damage actually caused. And if malice can be shown the defendant may be liable for punitive damages.
Here Kent was over the land of the World Tribune because he "hovered" over the "building." And he caused Gates to go onto the land because he put Gates on the "ledge." This caused actual damage because Gates accidentally caused a "panel to fall." Additional damages are implied by the fact “firemen” worked in the building “for hours” trying to rescue Gates. This disruption probably caused Tribune to suffer lost wages and lost profits.
Further, the possibility of malice is implied by the fact that Kent worked for one newspaper, the Daily Planet, and he disrupted business activities at what appears to be a competing newspaper, the World Tribune.
Therefore Kent would be liable for all damages he actually caused Tribune based on trespass to land, and may also be liable for punitive damages if implied malice could be proven.
FIREMAN FRANK V. KENT
6) BATTERY by TRANSFERRED INTENT?
Battery is defined above. Under tort law transferred intent means that a defendant that acts with intent to commit any tort injury on anyone will be liable for every injury inflicted on everyone, even if the person injured or the injury suffered is not what was originally intended. Some Courts limit the application of transferred intent, but it is more likely to be applied when the original tortious act was intended to inflict harm.

Here Kent intentionally acted to cause Gates to suffer assault, battery, false imprisonment and possibly intentional infliction of emotional distress, and he intended to cause a trespass to the land of the World Tribune. In turn, that caused Frank to suffer a “harmful touching”.
Therefore, Kent would be liable to Frank for battery by transferred intent.


[ANSWER EXPLANATION: This question has all of the common law intentional torts except for conversion and trespass to chattels. Why did Kent act? Because he intended to pull a “prank.” That fact expressly proves his acts were intentional. His physical acts imply intent, but the fact he wanted to pull a “prank” expressly proves intent. That saves you time.
Be prepared for batteries that cause “offense” but not harm. Being pushed around by a stranger is offensive to a reasonable person, and be prepared to state that.
The whole purpose of having fireman Frank hurt is to raise the issue of transferred intent. Did you spot the issue? Don’t turn to “negligence” when the acts causing harm are intentional.
If Frank was injured as the result of negligence by Kent or Gates, he might have no case because of the “Fireman’s Rule” that rescue personnel cannot sue for injuries suffered as a result of the negligence of others that creates the emergency situation to which they have responded. That is often codified in statute, and it expressly recognizes the issue that emergency personnel, by occupation, have assumed the risks of their employment.
But the Fireman’s Rule does not generally extend to injury caused by intentional torts.
Some professors insist that students “always discuss defenses”, and if your professor insists on that humor the prof and discuss defenses, even when there are no facts to suggest any. Often this sort of professor also wants the defenses discussed at the end of the essay in a “Defenses” section.
But generally the writers of law exam and bar exam questions will guide you by giving you facts to suggest the issues you are to discuss, and if you are not given any facts that suggest an issue it means they don’t want you to discuss that issue.
And generally question writers want and expect you to discuss the issues in the order in which they arise in the fact pattern.
If no facts are presented to suggest any plausible defense the writer is effectively saying, “I don’t want you to discuss defenses!” Here there are absolutely no facts to suggest that Kent has any plausible defense claims, so I didn’t waste my time discussing it.]`,
		Sample2: `PAULA V. TOM
NEGLIGENCE?
Paula’s only cause of action here is for NEGLIGENCE. Under tort law NEGLIGENCE is the failure to exercise that degree of care that a reasonably prudent person would use in the same circumstances. To establish a prima facie case Paula must generally prove DUTY, BREACH, ACTUAL AND PROXIMATE CAUSATION and DAMAGES.
1) DUTY?
Generally a person owes no duty to others. But a duty may be based on a STATUTE, a CONTRACT, a RELATIONSHIP, the ASSUMPTION of a duty, or PERIL caused by the defendant.
NEGLIGENCE PER SE?
If a STATUTE creates a duty, violating the statute may constitute NEGLIGENCE PER SE if the purpose of the statute was to protect the CLASS OF PEOPLE to which the plaintiff belongs, and the violation of the statute caused the plaintiff to suffer the TYPE OF INJURY the statute was intended to prevent.
Here Tom violated the law that prohibited fireworks in the National Forest, and that caused Paula to suffer injury. But she was not in the CLASS OF PEOPLE the statute was intended to protect because it was to protect people “on national lands” and she was “outside the National Forest boundaries”. Further, she did not suffer the TYPE OF INJURY the statute was intended to prevent because it was to “prevent forest fires and injury” while her injury was getting wet and having her money stolen.
Therefore, Paula would be unable to prove Tom was negligent per se.
DUTY BASED ON PERIL?
Under PALSGRAF, Cardozo said that a duty is only owed to those who are in the zone of danger caused by the defendant's acts. The Zone of Danger is the area where the defendant’s acts create reasonably foreseeable peril to others.
Andrews held that if the defendant owes a duty to anyone and breaches it, he should be liable for all injury actually and proximately caused by that breach.
Here the Zone of Danger was the gravel bar and the water area immediately around it because it was not reasonably foreseeable the firecrackers could cause peril to anyone outside that area. And there was nobody placed in danger within the zone of danger because “no one else was around” and there was “nothing that could burn”.
Paula appeared to be outside the zone of danger caused by Tom's activities because she was a "half mile downstream." Paula might argue that the zone of danger was larger than the small area of the “gravel bar” because Tom should have seen the possibility injury could occur farther away.
Therefore, it would be difficult for Paula to prove that Tom had any duty at all, and almost impossible for her to prove that she was placed in foreseeable peril by his actions.
2) BREACH?
Under tort law a BREACH is the failure to exercise DUE CARE. The standard of due care is that level of caution a reasonably prudent person would use in the same circumstance.
Here Tom went to great lengths to be sure his activities did not endanger anyone because he went to a "gravel bar" in the "middle of the river" with no one around so there would be no foreseeable danger to anyone. And once there he threw the firecrackers “carefully”.
Paula could only argue that a reasonably observant person would have seen the “log” floating down the river, and would have been careful not to throw any burning firecrackers onto it.
Therefore, it would be difficult for Paula to show that a reasonable person would have been any more careful than Tom.
3) ACTUAL CAUSE of injury to Paula?
Under tort law an act ACTUALLY CAUSES injury if the plaintiff would not have been injured but for the act.
Here Paula would not have fallen in the river and had her money stolen if Tom had not thrown the firecracker.
Therefore, Tom was the actual cause of Paula's injury.
4) PROXIMATE CAUSE of injury to Paula?
Under tort law PROXIMATE CAUSE means that the injury to the plaintiff was foreseeable, close in time and place to the acts of the defendant and a direct result of a chain of causation unbroken by unforeseeable intervening events.
Generally when there are two or more actual causes of an injury, the last, unforeseeable,
intentional act will be an UNFORESEEABLE INTERVENING EVENT that becomes the sole proximate cause, cutting off all liability arising from prior acts. Further, criminal acts and intentional torts by third parties are presumed to be unforeseeable absent additional specific facts.
Here Paula was rather far away from Tom in time and space, and it would not be foreseeable she could be injured by a firecracker at that distance. Further a reasonable person could not foresee that a firecracker would cause money to be stolen. Finally, even if Tom was the proximate cause of Paula falling in the river, he was not the proximate cause of her money being stolen because Harry’s criminal act was an unforeseeable intervening event.
Therefore, Paula probably could not prove Tom was the proximate cause of her fall into the river, and she certainly could not prove he was the proximate cause of her money being taken.
           

5) DAMAGES?
Under tort law DAMAGES are SPECIAL (out of pocket expense) and GENERAL (pain and suffering).
Here Paula had SPECIAL damages because she lost "two dollars" and she had GENERAL damages because she was "hurt and upset." But she got out of the river “laughingly” and was not “hurt and upset” until after she discovered the purse was stolen.
Therefore Paula suffered actual damages, but Tom was not the cause of those damages. 6) CONTRIBUTORY or COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE?
Under tort law CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE is a complete bar to recovery if the plaintiff was responsible in any manner for their injury. It is a MINORITY VIEW rule, and the MAJORITY approach is COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE which just reduces the plaintiff’s recovery based on the degree of fault of the plaintiff. In some states a plaintiff that is over 50% at fault for her own injuries is completely barred from recovery.
NEGLIGENCE PER SE is defined above. Tom might argue Paula was NEGLIGENT PER SE because she was fishing on the bridge where that is prohibited by statute. But Paula did not suffer the TYPE OF INJURY the statute was to prevent/ The purpose of the statute was “traffic safety” and she was not injured in a traffic accident.
Therefore any “negligence per se” argument by Tom would fail.
Tom’s better argument is that Paula was contributorily (comparatively) negligent because she sat “carelessly” and that placed her in PERIL of falling.
Therefore, Tom could easily prove Paula was “careless” and partly responsible for her own injury.
7) ASSUMPTION OF THE RISK?
Under tort law ASSUMPTION OF THE RISK is a complete defense when plaintiffs 1) put
themselves at risk, 2) with a full awareness of the risks, and 3) a conscious acceptance of the risks.
Here Paula put herself at risk because she “sat carelessly”. She had a full awareness of the risks that she could fall. And she appears to have consciously accepted those risks because the river was only a few “feet” below her, “she could swim” and it was a “nice day”.
Therefore Tom may be able to prove assumption of the risks.

Negligence is defined above.
8) DUTY?
Duty was defined above. Here Dick could only have a duty based on PERIL, and there is little evidence Dick’s act created reasonably foreseeable peril to anyone. The only foreseeable danger he caused by pushing the log in the river is that it might hit someone swimming in the river downstream. Therefore the “zone of danger” created by his act is the surface of the river downstream. There is no evidence anyone was in the river, and Paula was certainly not because she was on the bridge..
Therefore, there is no evidence Dick created any foreseeable peril to anyone, and if that could not be proven he did not owe Paula or anyone else a duty.
9) BREACH AND STANDARD OF CARE?
Breach was defined above. The STANDARD OF CARE for a child is to act in the manner reasonable children of the same age and experience act.
Here Dick was only “three years old” and he would only be negligent if he acted in a manner that children of that age do not reasonably act.
Since Dick was so young it is unlikely Paula could prove that he breached his duty, if he had a duty.
10) PROXIMATE CAUSE? Proximate cause is defined above.
Here Dick was even farther away from Paula than Tom, and it was even more unforeseeable that his act could harm her or anyone else.
Therefore, Paula would have even a more difficult time proving Dick was the cause of her injury.


[ANSWER EXPLANATION: This question focuses on the outer limits of DUTY to a remotely situated plaintiff (with firecracker yet, a la Palsgraf) and PROXIMATE CAUSATION of damage by some burning object floating down a river (a la Wagon Mound I and II). The question also focuses on the outer limits of BREACH because one cannot be breaching a duty by an act that poses no foreseeable risk to others.
Law schools tend to brainwash every student into thinking they can always sue, and win, for every injury. The truth is that Paula’s case is frivolous. ]`,
		Sample3: `TOM V. SAM
Under PRODUCT LIABILITY LAW a person who places an unreasonably dangerous product into the steam of commerce may be liable for the injury it causes. There are four basic theories on which a product liability action may be brought: Breach of Express Warranty, Breach of Implied Warranty, Negligence and Strict Liability.
1) UNREASONABLY DANGEROUS?
A product is unreasonably dangerous if it 1) poses serious and likely dangers, that 2) could be reduced or eliminated easily, 3) without damaging product utility, or else 4) the product utility does not justify the dangers posed.
Here the product presented serious and likely dangers because it could burst into flame under normal use, and those dangers could have been eliminated or reduced easily by putting a warning on the saw.
Therefore this was an unreasonably dangerous product at the time of sale. 2) BREACH OF EXPRESS WARRANTY?
Under tort law there is a BREACH OF EXPRESS WARRANTY if a product is sold with 1) express representations that the buyer 2) relies on and 3) the representations are incorrect and 4) it causes the purchaser injury. The seller is liable to foreseeable plaintiffs, those with privity of contract or their family.
Here Sam made express representations to Tom because he said the saw "would cut 36" trees" and Tom relied because he "bought" the saw. This was incorrect because the saw would only cut "18" trees", and this caused injury because Tom was "burned" when the saw caught on fire. And Tom had privity of contract because he was a "purchaser."
Therefore, Tom can recover under a breach of warranty theory
3) BREACH OF IMPLIED WARRANTY?
Under tort law there is a BREACH OF IMPLIED WARRANTY if a product is unsafe for ordinary use or for the buyer’s known intended use, the buyer relies on the expertise of the seller, and the buyer is injured as a result. The seller is liable to foreseeable plaintiffs, those with privity of contract or their family.
Here Tom would argue he bought the saw for ordinary use, relied on Sam’s expertise, and was injured as a result. Sam might argue that he did not know what Tom’s intended use was, and there was no evidence Tom relied on his expertise.
Therefore Tom can pursue recovery on a breach of implied warranty theory.

4) NEGLIGENCE?
Negligence is a failure to use the care a reasonable person would in the same circumstance. To prevail the plaintiff must prove duty, breach, actual cause, proximate cause and damages.
DUTY? Under tort law a person has a duty to not put an unreasonably dangerous product into the stream of commerce. Further, a person who makes express representations about a product assumes a duty of due care to make sure they are accurate and will not create peril.
Here Sam owed Tom a DUTY because he was the seller of a product that posed foreseeable harm.
BREACH? Sam BREACHED his duty because he "never read the owner's manual" and misrepresented the saw.
CAUSATION? That was the ACTUAL CAUSE of his injury because he would not have been hurt if he did not buy the saw. This was also the PROXIMATE CAUSE of injury because it was the direct and foreseeable result.
DAMAGES? Tom had INJURY because he was "burned." Therefore, Tom could recover on a negligence theory.
5) STRICT PRODUCT LIABILITY?
Under tort law a commercial seller of a product is strictly liable for personal injury or property damage if the product is unreasonably dangerous at the time it leaves the seller. The seller is liable to any person who is injured as a result.
Here Sam was a commercial seller because he had a store, the "Bargain Center", selling the product. And the product was unreasonably dangerous because it "burst into flames" in normal use and had "no warnings on the saw." This caused Tom injury because he was "burned."
Therefore, Tom can recover under strict product liability.
DICK V. SAM
6) BREACH OF EXPRESS WARRANTY?
Breach of express warranty is defined above.
Here Dick cannot recover under breach of express warranty because Sam only said he was an "expert" and "recommended" the saw. These are not express misrepresentations.

7) BREACH OF IMPLIED WARRANTY? Breach of implied warranty is defined above.
Here Dick relied on Sam’s expertise because Dick said he “didn’t know” about saws and Sam said he was an “expert”. And Sam knew Dick’s intended use of the saw because he said he wanted to cut "24" trees". Further, the saw was not safe because it could only cut 18" logs, and this caused injury because the saw "caught fire" and Dick was "burned".
Therefore, Dick can recover under breach of implied warranty.
8) NEGLIGENCE or STRICT PRODUCT LIABILITY?
Dick's rights under negligence or strict product liability are the same as Tom's.
HARRY V. SAM
9) BREACH OF EXPRESS or IMPLIED WARRANTY? Breach of warranty is explained above.
Here Harry did not buy the saw from Sam so there is no privity of contract between them and Harry was not a foreseeable plaintiff to Sam. Further, Sam made no express or implied representations to Harry.
Therefore, Harry cannot recover based on breach of warranty.
10) NEGLIGENCE? Negligence is defined above.
It is not clear that Sam was the PROXIMATE CAUSE of the injury to Harry because Moe's act of throwing the saw in the garbage appears to be an interceding event that breaks the chain of causation.
Therefore, Harry's injury might be too remote in place and causation for recovery on a negligence theory.
11) STRICT PRODUCT LIABILITY? Strict Product Liability is discussed above.
Here Sam would argue that even though he originally put the saw into the stream of commerce, it was TAKEN OUT OF THE STREAM OF COMMERCE because Moe threw it in the “garbage”.

Further, he would argue that Harry ASSUMED THE RISKS the saw was defective when he took it
out of the garbage.
Therefore, Harry might not be able to recover under strict product liability.


[ANSWER EXPLANATION: This question calls for a discussion of the four theories of product liability. The facts are intended to illustrate the differences between express and implied breach along with the fact that strict product liability theory extends to remote plaintiffs.
The preliminary discussion of whether this is an “unreasonably dangerous product” or not is very, very important. Stating the “balance” test given here is MANDATORY if you want to score maximum points.
Be wary of products that are not really “unreasonably dangerous” at all because they have been extensively tested, have great utility (often saves lives), pose trivial risks (turns hair green) to a very small number of users (less than 0.05%), and what little danger they pose is totally unknown to the manufacturer or simply cannot be easily eliminated. That is NOT an unreasonably dangerous product!
As for Harry, it is not clear if a person can prevail on a products liability claim if the product has been discarded, scrapped or abandoned. The purpose of product liability law is to protect consumers and regular users of products, not “Dumpster Divers”. There is a strong argument that a product is no longer in the “stream of commerce” after it has been discarded or scrapped.
Here it seems that Harry put the product back in the stream of commerce by retrieving it from the Dumpster. Also he has assumed the risk by doing that since he knew or should have known something might be wrong with a product that has been discarded.]`,
		Sample4: `WILSON v. BARBARA 1) DEFAMATION?
Under the law of torts DEFAMATION is a false statement of material fact of or about the plaintiff published to another party causing damage to the plaintiff's reputation. If the statement involves innuendo, interpretation, or knowledge of extrinsic facts it is DEFAMATION PER QUOD. Oral defamation is SLANDER and written or recorded defamation is LIBEL.
A false statement may be PRIVILEGED if the defendant speaks to defend a private interest, group interest or the public interest and does so without malice and in a reasonable manner calculated to defend that interest without unnecessarily harming the plaintiff.
Therefore, if Wilson can establish a prima facie case, and that Barbara was not privileged, Barbara can be liable for defamation.
2) Were there FALSE STATEMENTS OF FACT?
To establish a prima facie case, Wilson must show Barbara's objectionable comments were false. Her comments about his physical appearance, the slurred speech and bloodshot eyes, would be true and not defamatory because they do not, by themselves, cause loss of reputation.
Wilson's denial that he had been drinking might not be credible enough to prove the point. He may have difficulty proving factually that he had not been drinking.
Therefore, Wilson may not be able to prove the remarks were false.
3) Were the STATEMENTS ABOUT THE PLAINTIFF?
Here Barbara might say her remarks were not clearly about Wilson because she only said "someone" had done something. But the context within which the remarks were made, comments on an interview with Wilson and his physical appearance, made it clear Barbara's statements were about Wilson.
The statement involved innuendo and required extrinsic facts and interpretation because it referred to "his old ways." Therefore Barbara would argue this was a defamation PER QUOD, if at all. But Wilson would argue that since the remarks were made along with observations about "slurred speech" and "bloodshot eyes" viewers would interpret this as a reference to prior drinking problems even if they had no prior knowledge of extrinsic facts. Wilson would argue this was defamation PER SE.
Therefore, the remarks would reasonably be interpreted to be about Wilson.

4) Did Barbara PUBLISH her remarks?
Here Barbara clearly published her remarks because they were made "on TV."
5) Were the statements DAMAGING TO REPUTATION?
A statement that Wilson had become an alcoholic would be damaging to reputation because alcoholism is generally seen as a character flaw and undesirable in a person placed in a position of responsibility.
Therefore, the remarks were damaging to reputation.
6) Did Wilson SUFFER DAMAGE?
Under the law of torts DEFAMATION PER QUOD requires proof of SPECIAL DAMAGES before GENERAL DAMAGES will be presumed. Special damages will be presumed in a slander per se concerning criminal acts, a loathsome disease, unchaste behavior or improper business practices.
Here Wilson might argue that the claim he was alcoholic is equivalent to accusation of a loathsome disease. Barbara would dispute this, but alcoholism often is seen as a disease that might cause others to avoid the plaintiff.
Barbara would argue that her statements were not defamatory on their face (not per se) because they involved innuendo and required interpretation. Wilson would dispute this.
Wilson would argue he had suffered SPECIAL DAMAGES because his "popularity fell" and he did not get a position he wanted. Barbara would argue that this did not damage Wilson because he was a "former" politician and "almost a recluse." Further, she would argue that Wilson "had little chance" of getting the post, so her broadcast did not cause his loss.
Therefore, damages may be presumed, or Wilson may be able to prove damages.
7) Is Wilson a PUBLIC FIGURE PLAINTIFF?
Under New York Times v. Sullivan a plaintiff that is a public figure must prove actual malice, statements made with knowledge or reckless disregard for their falsity. A public figure is one who injects themselves into the public arena.
Here Wilson had been inactive in the public arena because he was "almost a recluse" and only a "former governor." Barbara would argue that Wilson agreed to be "interviewed at his home" for a "TV" show, and hoped to become the "State Republican Chair."
Therefore, Wilson had been in the public eye, was placing himself in the public arena by willingly being interviewed, and was a public figure.

8) Can Wilson prove ACTUAL MALICE?
Appendix B: Sample Answers
 Actual malice means statements made with knowledge of or reckless disregard for their falsity. Reckless disregard means intentionally acting without awareness and with negligent disregard for the clear and serious risk to others.
Here Barbara did not act with knowledge her statement was false because she "suspected" it was true. But there was a clear risk of injury to Wilson because she made comments "on TV" that would damage him.
Wilson would argue she acted with a reckless disregard of whether her comments were true or not because she had an opportunity to ask Wilson and "did not ask."
Barbara would argue it was not reckless disregard because Wilson would only have denied drinking. She would show that no further effort on her part would have clarified the matter any further.
Therefore, Barbara probably would be held to have not acted with actual malice.

[ANSWER EXPLANATION: This question requires discussion of defamation actions by public figures. It is an example of defamation using innuendo, interpretation (COLLOQUIUM) or knowledge of extrinsic facts (INDUCEMENT).
A definition and discussion of actual malice is necessary. Actual malice may be based on recklessness. When it comes to recklessness, this question is a wobbler because Barbara clearly could have asked and then reported "Wilson denies a drinking problem."
If Wilson was not a public figure, he would only have to prove the falsity of Barbara’s statements and that they were of the sort that would damage his reputation. Barbara might then claim she was PRIVILEGED to make the statements, even if they were false. But she would have to prove she acted in a ‘reasonable manner’ without malice to protect the public interest. But she would not be able to prove that because it is not clear what “public interest” she is protecting, and it would not be reasonable to make damning statements of this type on TV about a private individual without at least questioning the person about it first directly.
PRIVILEGE is frequently tested and poorly taught so be sure to consider it in any defamation question. Did the defendant have a legitimate reason to speak out, and did they do it in a reasonable manner? The 1st Amendment does not protect defamatory statements, but it does protect the right to speak out to protect legitimate interests, as long as the defendant acts reasonably and without malice. Privilege defines the balance between these two conflicting rules of law.]`,
		Sample5: `ELLEN v. INKWIRE 1) FALSE LIGHT?
Under tort law FALSE LIGHT is the intentional act of publishing a false portrayal of the plaintiff in a manner causing ridicule or embarrassment.
Here Inkwire published a portrayal about Ellen because it "reported she was a secret philanthropist." This was a false portrayal because she was a "tightwad." And this caused her embarrassment because she was "besieged with requests" that were "professionally impossible" to reject. Ellen's damages would generally be measured by the amount of embarrassment she was caused.
Therefore, Inkwire may be liable for invasion of privacy under a false light theory.
2) INTRUSION?
Under tort law INTRUSION is an unreasonable intrusion into the peace and solitude of the plaintiff. Damages are measured by the value of lost solitude to the plaintiff.
Here there was an unreasonable intrusion because Dick sent a "submarine" to photograph Ellen through a "telephoto lens". It disturbed her peace and solitude because she had attempted to be alone in a secluded place "miles" from shore with a "posted lookout." Ellen suffered damages because it "embarrassed her" into "seclusion" in her home for "six weeks."
Dick would argue that Ellen had no reasonable expectation of privacy because she was "in international waters." Ellen would counter that she had a reasonable expectation of privacy because of the location and precautions she had taken.
Therefore, Inkwire may be liable for intrusion.
3) APPROPRIATION OF LIKENESS?
Under tort law APPROPRIATION is the unauthorized use of the name or likeness of a person in a manner that implies endorsement of a product or support of a cause, but not mere publication of names and photos as news articles. Damages are generally measured by the profit to the defendant.
Here there was a use of Ellen's photo and name because billboards with her "picture" said "Ellen D. Generate" buys their paper. And the use was not authorized because she did not give permission. The purpose of the billboards was to profit by implying she endorsed their paper.
Ellen's damages would generally be measured by the profits Inkwire made from using her likeness.

4) PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF PRIVATE FACTS?
Under tort law PUBLIC DISCLOSURE is the unreasonable public disclosure of private facts that a reasonable person would find embarrassing.
Here there was a public disclosure because Inkwire "ran the interview" in its publication. And the facts were private facts because they were told to the ex-boyfriend in "strictest confidence." These were embarrassing facts because they concerned an "abortion", a matter of personal intimacy, and of a nature likely to cause public disdain and ridicule. Ellen would argue Inkwire acted in an unreasonable manner.
Inkwire would argue that it acted reasonably because these facts were a matter of legitimate public concern since Ellen had injected herself into the public arena as a "strong and vocal anti- abortion advocate." Inkwire would argue the public had a right to know Ellen's true background since she sought to influence public opinion on this controversial topic.
Therefore, Ellen might fail to show Inkwire acted unreasonably.

[ANSWER EXPLANATION: This question calls for discussion of each of the four Invasion of Privacy torts -- False Light, Appropriation of Likeness, Intrusion and Disclosure of Private Facts (LAID).
The focus in intrusion and disclosure is on the unreasonableness of the acts of the defendant. It is not unreasonable to take a picture of a naked lady if she is lying on a public beach, but it is unreasonable to take the same picture by going to great lengths to avoid detection because it violates “reasonable expectations of privacy”.
The term “money damages” generally means an award intended to compensate the plaintiff for losses suffered in terms of property damage, lost income, inconvenience, lost privacy, embarrassment, pain and suffering, etc. But the plaintiff can also request damages measured by the unjust enrichment the defendant would otherwise reap. In that case the plaintiff is said to have, “waived the tort and sued in restitution”, and the damage award in that case is often referred to as “damages in restitution”. In most cases of False Light, Intrusion and Disclosure of Private Facts the plaintiff is suing for compensatory damages, and in most cases of Appropriation of Likeness the plaintiff is suing for damages in restitution.
The term “damages” is broadly misused to mean “money judgment” and students are strongly advised to get (and read) Nailing the Bar’s Simple Remedies Outline early in their law school career.]`,	
		Sample6: `KEN v. COUNTY
1) PRIVATE NUISANCE?
Under tort law PRIVATE NUISANCE is an unreasonable interference with the plaintiffs’ use and enjoyment of their land.
Here there was some interference because the County airport caused "noise" that prevented Ken from "enjoying his yard" and "hearing the birds." And this involved the use of Ken's land because it was his "house" and "yard."
The two elements that would be most difficult to prove are whether Ken suffered significant damages, and whether the County action was unreasonable. The County would argue that the noise was insufficient interference to prevent Ken from enjoying his land because Ken "didn't think the noise was so bad" when he bought the house. He in effect CAME TO THE NUISANCE, and that fact suggests the situation was not as bad as Ken claims.
But Ken would try to prove that the interference was unreasonable because the County let flights increase “ten percent" in only "four years."
The County would also argue it did not cause the nuisance, and had not acted irresponsibly. The County might argue it was not responsible because the increase in noise was caused by "military use" beyond their control. Alternatively, the County would argue that it acted reasonably because the flights were in response to the "Romaria crisis."
Ken would argue he suffered damages because the value of his home was less that it otherwise would be. But the County would argue there was no proof of financial loss because the home had gone up in value and the claim of loss was speculative. Further, the County would argue there was no proof the birds did not sing as much as before.
Therefore, the County might be liable for private nuisance depending on whether Ken could prove these legal elements.
2) PUBLIC NUISANCE?
Under tort law PUBLIC NUISANCE is an unreasonable interference with the plaintiff's use and enjoyment of public resources causing her particular injury that is different or greater than the general public.
Here the noise interferes with the enjoyment of public land because it prevents Ken from "hearing the birds sing" on the "public river parkway."
The County may argue that Ken lacks standing because he does not suffer any injury that is different from any other member of the public. But Ken suffers particular injury because his home is "on the river" and he could hear the birds sing "from his backyard."

Ken would have to prove the other elements of nuisance which are discussed above under private nuisance.
Therefore, the County may be liable for public nuisance, depending on whether Ken can prove the County’s action is unreasonable and produces significant damages.
3) COMING TO THE NUISANCE?
Under tort law COMING TO THE NUISANCE is the defense that the plaintiff moved to the location where the condition complained of already existed. It is a complete bar in a MINORITY view, but in the MAJORITY view it is only a factor to be considered in determining damages.
Here Ken moved to the location because he "purchased the home." And the condition already existed because he "realized his home was in the flight path" and the "realtor disclosed the fact."
Ken would argue that even though problems existed when he bought the home, they worsened after that. Further, he would argue that in any event the County action is unreasonable per se.
Therefore, the court would consider Ken's coming to the nuisances only as a factor in determining damages in most States.
4) REMEDIES?
The REMEDIES for a nuisance action include both money damages and injunctive relief.
If the nuisance is a temporary situation money damages measured by the loss of use for the period of the nuisance will be an adequate remedy. If the nuisance would continue but for injunctive relief, the Court would consider granting an injunction. Injunctive relief is an equitable remedy, and the court has discretion to deny it. The Court will balance the interests of the parties, the interests of third parties and the feasibility of judicial enforcement. If the Court denies injunctive relief, the appropriate remedy is an award of money damages measured by the loss of property value caused by the nuisance.
Here the nuisance is a permanent condition, so the Court would consider injunctive relief. But the interest of third parties, people who use the airport, the military, and the County residents would be so significant the Court is unlikely to issue an injunction stopping the airport from continuing operations.
Therefore the Court would most likely award Ken money damages to reflect the loss of market value of his property caused by the increase in airport traffic.

[ANSWER EXPLANATION: This question is roughly based on true events. The point to remember is that "coming to the nuisance" is not a complete bar to recovery. If a defendant unreasonably interferes with the use of land, a new purchaser might "buy into the right to sue" for a nuisance the previous owner did not litigate.
Just state the rule and prove (or disprove) the elements. Here Ken’s case is rather weak, so you may have to give “conditional” conclusions.
Discussion of “defenses” and “remedies” is mandatory because the CALL specifically asks for it.]`,
		Sample7: `STAR v. BUCK 1) FRAUD?
Under tort law FRAUD is based on false representations of fact by the defendant made knowingly with intent to deceive that are reasonably relied upon by the plaintiff causing damages.
Here Buck made a statement of fact when he said a franchise "would be granted" if the location was suitable, and that was false because he had “no intention” of granting Star a franchise. He intended to deceive because he wanted her to reveal the location, and Star reasonably relied on his representation because she did reveal the location. That caused her damages because Buck used the information to convince Jack not to lease the “perfect location” to Star.
Buck also made false statements when he told Star the location was "too small for a franchise." He intended to deceive her so she would not go through with her lease plans. And she reasonably relied on that statement because she “withdrew” her offer to Jack. That caused her damages because she otherwise would have secured the lease.
Therefore, Star can prove the elements of fraud and Buck may be liable for the damages she suffered.
2) TORTIOUS INTERFERENCE?
Under tort law INTERFERENCE is an unreasonable interference with the plaintiff's known business relationships causing damages.
Here Buck interfered with Star's business relationship with Jack by suggesting to him that "Star drank" and was a "bad tenant choice". Buck also interfered by telling Star the space was "too small for a coffee shop".
Buck did these acts knowing that he was interfering with the business relationship between Jack and Star because Jack had told him he, "promised the location to Star." The acts were unreasonable because they were intentional false statements intended to damage Star. And they caused Star damages because it prevented her from completing the lease agreement with Jack.
Therefore, Buck can be liable for tortious interference.
3) ABUSE OF PROCESS?
Under tort law ABUSE OF PROCESS is bringing a civil action against the plaintiff without
legitimate basis out of malice and for an improper purpose.
Here Buck brought a civil action against Star because he "sued Star for slander." And he had no legitimate basis because all of Star's statements were true. Buck acted out of malice and for an improper purpose because he was trying to refute Star's statements and hide the truth.
Therefore, Buck could be liable for abuse of process.
[ANSWER EXPLANATION: This very short question is intended to focus on the elements that must be proven for fraud, interference, and abuse of process.
Intentional infliction, defamation and false light were excluded by the call because they are covered in other questions.
There is no evidence of IIED anyway because Star did not suffer “severe emotional distress.” You are unlikely to ever get such a short, simple question on a real exam.]`
	},
	Criminal: {
		Sample1: `STATE V. TOM
1. CONSPIRACY?
Under common law a CONSPIRACY is an agreement between two or more people to work toward an illegal goal. Modernly an overt step toward the criminal goal is often required. Conspiracy does not merge into the ultimate crime.
Here there was an implied agreement between Tom and Dick, two people, for an illegal goal, because they "burst" into the store together and "wanted to rob" the store. They committed an overt step toward their goal because of this.
Therefore Tom can be charged with conspiracy.
2. ATTEMPTED ROBBERY?
Under criminal law an ATTEMPTED ROBBERY is committed with there is a SUBSTANTIAL STEP taken toward committing a robbery. A robbery is a LARCENY, a trespassory taking of personal property with an intent to permanently deprive, from a person by force or fear overcoming the will of the victim to resist.
Here Tom took a SUBSTANTIAL STEP toward completing the robbery because he went to the store "with a gun" and "burst" through the door. And his goal was the crime of robbery because he "wanted to rob" the store.
Therefore, Tom can be charged with attempted robbery.
3. DEFENSE OF MISTAKE OF FACT?
Under criminal law a mistake of fact is a valid defense if it NEGATES IMPLIED CRIMINAL INTENT. Attempt is a SPECIFIC INTENT crime, so any mistake of fact that negates criminal intent is a valid defense.
Here Tom made a mistake because he thought the store was open for business, but that mistake does not negate intent because he "wanted to rob" the store.
Therefore, Tom's mistake of fact does not negate his criminal intent, and his defense argument fails.

4. BURGLARY?
Under the common law a burglary was a breaking and entering of the dwelling of another in the nighttime with intent to commit a felony. Further, a CONSTRUCTIVE BREAKING would be found if an entry was made by trick, threat of violence or with the help of a conspirator. MODERNLY burglary has been extended to almost any structure and all times of the day. If a larceny is not a felony, it still supports a charge of burglary. And modernly a constructive breaking will be found if there is any TRESPASSORY ENTRY, an entry without permission, express or implied.
Here there was no entry to a dwelling, and the entry was through an "open" door. Therefore, no common law burglary occurred. But there was an entry to a structure because they entered a "store" and it was with intent to commit a felony because they "wanted to rob" the store. Finally, a CONSTRUCTIVE BREAKING would be found modernly because their entry was trespassory. It was trespassory because the store was not open for business, and they had no permission to enter it, either expressly or impliedly.
Therefore they could be charged with burglary modernly but could not have been charged at common law.
5. LARCENY?
Under common law LARCENY was the trespassory taking and carrying away of the personal property of another with intent to permanently deprive. Modernly it is codified as "theft".
At common law some Courts held that property attached to the land could not be the subject of a larceny because it was real property and not personal property. Other courts disagreed, and modernly all courts would hold that when property is severed from the land to be stolen it is transformed from real property to personal property and can then be the subject of a larceny.
Here Tom took and carried personal property of another because he "ripped the security camera" from the wall and took it to the "river", and he intended to permanently deprive because he threw it in the river.
Therefore Tom can be charged with larceny.
6. MURDER OF THE BABY?
MURDER is an unlawful HOMICIDE, the killing of one human being by another with MALICE AFORETHOUGHT. MALICE for murder can be 1) an express INTENT TO KILL, or implied by 2) intent to commit GREAT BODILY INJURY, 3) a homicide caused by commission of an INHERENTLY DANGEROUS FELONY, the "FELONY MURDER RULE" or 3) DELIBERATE CREATION OF EXTREME RISKS to human life with AWARENESS of the risks and a CONSCIOUS DISREGARD for them, the "DEPRAVED HEART" murder.
Under the common law and broadly adopted modern law a HUMAN BEING is a person that has been born alive and is not yet dead. About half the States have adopted FETAL-MURDER statutes which define the killing of a fetus with malice aforethought punishable as a murder, but they vary widely. The death of a fetus cannot qualify as a manslaughter.
Murder may be charged under the FELONY-MURDER RULE if a death is caused by the commission of an inherently dangerous felony, but only if the death is caused by acts done during the RES GESTAE of the underlying felony. The RES GESTAE of a crime is the sequence of events from the first substantial step to committing the crime and ending when the defendants leave the scene of the crime and reach a place of relative safety.
Here there was no homicide because the baby was "born dead" and not born alive. But this may be defined as a murder under a fetal-murder statute in some States because the fetus was "full term."
Even if this State had a fetal-murder statute, malice for murder could not be based on intent to kill, intent to cause great bodily injury or depraved heart because the collision was by "accident" and at a reasonable speed of "75".
Further, malice could not be based on the felony-murder rule because the death occurred after the res gestae the attempted robbery had ended. It ended when they at a place of "relative safety" and were able to watch "TV".
Therefore, Tom cannot be charged with murder because there is no basis for finding malice, even if there was a fetal-murder statute.
7. INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER.
Under criminal law INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER is an UNINTENTIONAL homicide without malice aforethought resulting from GROSS NEGLIGENCE, RECKLESSNESS or the commission of a MALUM IN SE CRIME that is not inherently dangerous enough for application of the felony murder rule.
GROSS (CRIMINAL) NEGLIGENCE is the deliberate breach of a pre-existing duty to protect others from extreme risks, and RECKLESSNESS is the deliberate creation of extreme risks to others.
As discussed above, the death of a fetus does not qualify as a manslaughter. Therefore, Tom's act was not sufficient to charge him with involuntary manslaughter.
8. MURDER of Victor?
Murder, defined above, can be based on the DEPRAVED HEART doctrine where one acts unreasonably to DELIBERATELY CREATE EXTREME RISKS TO OTHERS, the actus reus, with AWARENESS of the risks and a CONSCIOUS DISREGARD for the risks, the mens rea.
Here Tom caused a homicide because he killed Victor, a human being. And he deliberately created extreme risks because he drove down the "crowded surface streets" at "80 mph".

Further, he was aware of the risks because he was in full control of his faculties. And he
consciously disregarded the risks because he continued to do this without any compelling reason. Therefore, Tom can be charged with the murder of Victor.

STATE V. DICK.
9. CONSPIRACY, ATTEMPTED ROBBERY, BURGLARY and LARCENY?
Dick was an equal participant in the crimes of conspiracy, attempted robbery, burglary and larceny, and did all of the same things as Tom relative to these acts.
Therefore Dick was DIRECTLY LIABLE and could be charged with each of these crimes on the same facts and legal theories as explained for Tom above.
10. MURDER of Victor?
Tom killed Victor and not Dick, and since "Dick was silent" and not urging Tom to run over Victor or do anything criminal, Dick could only be charged with this murder based on a vicarious liability theory. There are two vicarious liability theories: conspiracy theory and accomplice theory.
CONSPIRACY THEORY? A person may be charged with vicarious liability for a crime based on CONSPIRACY THEORY if while they are a member of a conspiracy a co-conspirator commits the crime within the scope of the conspiracy. But a conspiracy ends when the criminal goal is ATTAINED or ABANDONED.
Here Dick was a member of a conspiracy to rob the store, but that conspiracy goal was abandoned when they found the store closed. Since the conspiracy had ended, Tom did not kill Victor the next day "within the scope" of the conspiracy.
Therefore Dick cannot be charged on this basis.
ACCOMPLICE THEORY? A person who commits or helps commit a crime is liable for all subsequent crimes by co-felons that are a direct and natural result of the prior crimes.
Here Dick helped Tom try to rob the store the prior day, so he would be liable for any crimes by Tom that are a direct and natural result of the attempted robbery. But the murder of Victor was not a foreseeable result of the prior robbery attempt.
Therefore Dick cannot be charged with Victor's death based on accomplice liability. Since Dick had no direct liability or vicarious liability he cannot be charged with Murder.

[ANSWER EXPLANATION: The main points here are that:
1) Modernly a burglary generally requires a trespassory entry, an entry without permission to
enter, and does not necessarily require a physical breaking. 2) A fetus is not generally considered a human being.
3) There are fetal-murder statutes you might need to discuss, but there are no "fetal-manslaughter" statutes (or if there are it is extremely unusual).
4) The felony-murder rule cannot be applied to a death that results from acts done so long after the robbery that they were not part of the res gestae of the crime.
5) There is no conspiracy liability for crimes committed by co-conspirators after the conspiracy has ended.
6) Accomplices in one crime are not automatically liable for all subsequent crimes committed by other accomplices, even if they are committed in their presence unless there is some direct and natural causality linking the second crime back to the first crime.]`,
		Sample2: `STATE V. HUEY
1) CONSPIRACY?
Under common law a CONSPIRACY was an agreement between two or more people to pursue an illegal goal. Modernly an overt step taken toward the criminal goal is often required. Conspiracy does not merge into the criminal goal. A conspirator may be charged with all crimes by co- conspirators while they are members of the conspiracy that are within the scope of the conspiracy agreement, foreseeable acts in furtherance of the conspiracy goal.
Here Huey agreed with another person because he "agreed" with "Louie", and the agreement was to pursue an illegal goal because it was to "kidnap Millie" and hold her for ransom. They took an overt step because they did kidnap her.
Therefore, Huey can be charged with conspiracy.
2) EFFECTIVELY WITHDRAW from the conspiracy?
Under criminal law EFFECTIVE WITHDRAWAL from a conspiracy is a defense to liability for subsequent crimes by co-conspirators if the defendant gives notice to the other conspirators of intent to withdraw and then the defendant must act to thwart the conspiracy from attaining its goal.
Here Huey gave notice because he told Louie "I quit." And he acted to thwart the conspiracy because he "told the police."
However, Huey did not act to thwart the conspiracy until after the kidnapping, rape and death of Millie. Withdrawal only is a defense to subsequent crimes by co-conspirators and here the withdrawal was not effective until after all crimes had been committed.
Therefore, Huey effectively withdrew from the conspiracy when he told the police everything, but that did not absolve him from crimes that occurred before that time.
3) KIDNAPPING?
Under criminal law a KIDNAPPING is the unlawful taking or confining of a person against their will.
Here Huey took and confined Millie against her will because he and Louie "kidnapped Millie". Therefore, Huey can be charged with kidnapping.

4) RAPE under a theory of ACCOMPLICE LIABILITY?
Appendix B: Sample Answers
 Under criminal law RAPE is unlawful intercourse with a person without consent. An accomplice to a crime may be charged with all subsequent crimes committed by other accomplices if they were foreseeable as the direct and natural results of their own criminal acts.
Here Louie had intercourse with Millie because they "had sex." And it was without consent because Millie only agreed to intercourse because she had been kidnapped and Louie said he "would let her go in exchange." Since she was being held against her will and under duress, her apparent consent to intercourse was not effective.
Therefore, Louie raped Millie, and that rape was foreseeable to Huey as a direct and natural consequence of his own crime of kidnapping Millie. This was all direct and natural, and should have been foreseeable to Huey because he knew "Louie was a convicted rapist."
Therefore, Huey may be charged with the rape of Millie under a theory of accomplice liability.
5) MURDER of Millie?
Under criminal law murder is an unlawful homicide, the killing of one human being by another with malice aforethought. Malice for murder may be 1) express intent to kill, or implied by 2) intentionally causing great bodily injury, 3) intentionally committing an inherently dangerous felony, the FELONY-MURDER RULE, or 4) intentionally acting with an awareness of and conscious disregard for unreasonable risks to human life, the DEPRAVED HEART THEORY. At common law there were no degrees of murder but modernly statutes define first degree murder as those that are 1) willful, deliberate and premeditated, 2) by enumerated means, or 3) caused by the commission of enumerated dangerous felonies. All other murders are in the second degree.
Under criminal law one of the "inherently dangerous felonies" for application of the felony- murder rule is RAPE.
Here there was a homicide because Millie was a human being and she died as a result of the acts of Louie.
Huey would argue that Millie committed suicide and not homicide. But her death by her own hand was directly caused by the rape by Louie. She would not have killed herself if she had not been raped, and she would not have been raped if Huey had not kidnapped her and left her with Louie. The rape by Louie was foreseeable to Huey at the time of the kidnapping, so his own acts were the actual and proximate cause of her death. Huey and Louie effectively caused Millie to be the instrumentality of her own death.
Further, because Huey acted to place Millie at peril, he had an affirmative duty to protect her from the results of that peril, including protecting her from both Louie and her own suicidal impulses.
Therefore, the state would successfully argue that this was a homicide and not a simple suicide.

And the state would argue the FELONY-MURDER RULE applies to prove malice aforethought for
murder because Millie died because of the commission of an inherently dangerous crime, rape.
As an alternative, the State may also argue that DEPRAVED HEART THEORY applies. Huey kidnapped Millie and left her with Louie, deliberate acts that created extreme risks to human life, and he did that with an awareness of and conscious disregard for the risk to human life because he knew Louie was a "rapist".
Therefore, Huey could be charged with murder on a FELONY-MURDER or DEPRAVED HEART theory.
6) MURDER of Louie?
Under the REDLINE RULE the killing of a criminal accomplice by any party other than another
criminal accomplice during the commission of an inherently dangerous felony cannot be used as a basis for charging murder under the FELONY-MURDER RULE.
Here there was a homicide because Louie was a human being and he was "killed by police." But the police shooting of Louie was a justified act to prevent a felony.
Therefore, Huey cannot be charged with FELONY-MURDER of Louie.
[ANSWER EXPLANATION: This question points out two issues. Conspiracy liability only extends to acts within the SCOPE OF THE CONSPIRACY, meaning they must be foreseeable acts in furtherance of the conspiracy goal. But, accomplice liability extends to all foreseeable crimes by co-felons that are a direct and natural result of an initial crime. Here the rape is a direct and natural result of the kidnapping, so Huey is liable based on accomplice theory even if he is not liable based on conspiracy theory.
Secondly, Huey failed to effectively withdraw by acting to thwart the conspiracy, so he ends up liable for crimes that occurred after he said, "I quit."
But Huey cannot be charged with murder for the death of Louie (in many or most States) because of the Redline Rule.]`,
		Sample3: `STATE v. TOM 1) MURDER?
Under criminal law MURDER is an unlawful HOMICIDE, the killing of one human being by another, with MALICE aforethought. Malice for murder can be 1) express intent to kill or implied by 2) intent to cause great bodily injury, 3) intent to commit an inherently dangerous felony, the FELONY MURDER RULE or 4) intent to act with awareness of and conscious disregard for an unreasonably high risk to human life, the DEPRAVED HEART theory.
Under common law there were no degrees of murder, but modernly FIRST DEGREE murder is 1) willful, deliberate and premeditated, 2) murder by enumerated means or 3) murder during enumerated dangerous felonies. All other murder is second degree.
Here there was a homicide because Dick was a human being and he was "killed" by another human being, Oscar. But Tom did not do anything intending to cause Dick or anyone else to be killed or intending to cause great bodily injury to anyone.
Further, Tom was not engaged in commission of an "inherently dangerous felony" at the time so the felony-murder rule has no application. Therefore the only basis for charging Tom with murder would be the DEPRAVED HEART THEORY.
Tom did not deliberately create extreme risks to other people. He could not have reasonably foreseen Oscar would start shooting. Even if some danger could have been foreseen, Tom was not aware of it and did not consciously disregard the risks because he was "in a daze".
Therefore, Tom did not appear to deliberately create and consciously disregard extreme risks to others, and cannot be charged with murder under the DEPRAVED HEART theory unless that could be proven.
If murder could be charged here, it would be second degree murder because the death was not willful and deliberate, during a typically enumerated felony or by a typically enumerated means.
2) INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER?
Involuntary manslaughter is an unintentional homicide resulting from GROSS NEGLIGENCE, RECKLESSNESS or the commission of a MALUM IN SE crime insufficient to support the felony murder rule.
GROSS (CRIMINAL) NEGLIGENCE is the deliberate breach of a pre-existing duty to protect others from extreme risks, and RECKLESSNESS is the deliberate creation of extreme risks to others.
Here there was an unintentional homicide because Dick died and Tom did not intend for him to die. And Tom was not committing any crime because smuggling Viagra was "not a crime." The MISTAKE OF LAW by Tom does not make an otherwise innocent act a crime.

Further, resisting unlawful arrest is not a crime. Here the arrest was unlawful because there was
"no probable cause" and the police wanted to "harass" and "beat" Tom and Dick.
And Tom was not grossly negligent because he drove "55 mph" and did not deliberately create extreme risks to others.
The State could only argue that Tom created extreme risks by refusing to stop his car, but he did not deliberately create those risks because he had an "overwhelming phobia", was "scared to death" and "could not bring himself to stop" the car.
Therefore, Tom could not be charged with involuntary manslaughter unless it could be proven his failure to stop was criminally negligent.
3) SELF-DEFENSE?
Under criminal law a defendant is privileged to use reasonable force as necessary for SELF- DEFENSE.
Here Tom acted to defend himself from harm because he was "scared to death" and Oscar wanted to "beat him." Oscar had no legal right to stop Tom because he had no probable cause. And Tom acted reasonably and used reasonable force because he only "drove at 55 mph".
The state may argue Tom acted unreasonably by refusing to stop, even if the police lacked probable cause, but there is no legal basis for such a claim.
Therefore, Tom would succeed in his defense that he acted in reasonable self-defense. 4) INSANITY?
Under criminal law INSANITY is a defense that negates criminal intent. Under the M'NAUGHTEN RULE a person is insane if a disease of the mind so impairs their reasoning that they are unable to appreciate the nature and quality of their acts or to know that they are wrong. Under the IRRESISTIBLE IMPULSE theory a person may raise the defense of insanity if they are unable to control their acts, even if they know the act is wrong.
Here Tom could not plead M'Naughten because "he knew it was wrong". But Tom could plead an irresistible impulse because "he had an overwhelming phobia" and "he could not help himself".
Therefore, Tom might be successful with an insanity defense.
[ANSWER EXPLANATION: This question is quirky so paddling is necessary. Even if Tom and Dick were committing a crime it was not one of the "inherently dangerous crimes of rape, robbery, burglary or arson" so the felony-murder rule has no application here.
Tom could only be charged under Depraved Heart. For that it must be shown he created extreme risks to others with an awareness of the risks and a conscious disregarded for them. But how could he have foreseen Oscar was crazy enough to shoot Dick? If Tom acted unreasonably enough to be charged with murder, he could not show he acted reasonably for a plea of self-defense]`,
		Sample4: `STATE v. JIM
1) ARSON?
Under common law ARSON was the malicious burning of the dwelling of another. Modernly arson has been extended to the malicious burning of almost any structure. Malice for arson requires a burning with wrongful intent..
Here Jim caused a burning of a structure because the "wall" of the school "classroom" was "singed."
And Jim acted with malice because he acted with the wrongful intent of setting the fire to make himself look like a "hero." This was wrongful because he did it to disrupt the school and knowing it would damage the school's wastepaper basket.
Therefore, Jim can be charged with arson. 2) LARCENY of wallet?
Under criminal law LARCENY is the trespassory taking and carrying away of the personal property of another with an intent to permanently deprive. Modernly it is defined as THEFT. Under the RELATION BACK doctrine some courts held that an initial taking of lost property with intent to return property to the owner becomes trespassory when a later decision to steal "relates back" to the original taking. Other courts held that the finder of lost property holds it in "CONSTRUCTIVE TRUST" for the rightful owner and a later taking was an EMBEZZLEMENT.
Here Jim took and carried personal property of another because he "picked up" and "took" the "wallet belonging to Sue." However, at the time Jim took the wallet he did not have any intent to permanently deprive so that taking was not trespassory.
Later Jim formed a larcenous intent when he became "depressed", "pocketed Sue's money" and "threw" the wallet into the river. This was a trespassory taking and Jim clearly intended to permanently deprive because he threw the wallet into the river. This larcenous intent related back to the original taking under the RELATION BACK doctrine.
Therefore, Jim can be charged with larceny in a Court that recognizes the RELATION BACK theory.
3) EMBEZZLEMENT of wallet?
Under criminal law EMBEZZLEMENT is an intentional trespassory conversion of personal property of another by one entrusted with lawful possession. Modernly it is defined as THEFT.
As stated above, some Courts held that a decision to keep lost property after originally intending to return it was an EMBEZZLEMENT based on CONSTRUCTIVE TRUST THEORY.

Here there was no trespassory taking of the wallet because Jim "intended to return" it. Once he had the wallet he held it in constructive trust. But there was a trespassory conversion with intent to deprive because he decided to keep the money.
Therefore Jim could be charged with embezzlement in a Court that holds to the CONSTRUCTIVE TRUST THEORY.
4) EMBEZZLEMENT of $10? Embezzlement is defined above.
Here Jim was entrusted with possession because Chester "gave him $10 to buy tickets." This was personal property because it was money. And Jim intentionally and trespassorily converted the money to his own use with intent to permanently deprive because he "decided to keep it" and "used it to buy cigarettes and Playboy magazines."
Therefore, Jim can be charged with embezzlement. 5) LARCENY of $20 BY TRICK?
Under criminal law LARCENY BY TRICK is the trespassory carrying away of the personal property of another with an intent to permanently deprive after gaining possession by means of a misrepresentation of fact. Modernly it is defined as THEFT.
Here Jim trespassorily carried away personal property of another because he took "Chester's $20" to buy himself cigarettes and Playboy magazines. And it was personal property because it was money.
Jim had an intent to permanently deprive because his intent at the time he gained possession was to "steal it." And Jim used a misrepresentation of fact because he said he would use the money to "buy pictures" when his true intent was to "steal it."
Therefore, Jim can be charged with larceny of the $20 by trick.
[ANSWER EXPLANATION: This question raises the issues of the malicious intent for arson. It is not arson to burn a building by accident unless the fire was not set for a "malicious" purpose.
Malice for arson means for a "wrongful" but not necessarily illegal purpose. The purpose for the fire is malicious if the defendant started it to injure or frighten people or to damage their property. If a fire is set to clear brush on the defendant's land and for no other purpose it is not malicious, even if the fire violated local burn-control laws. But if the fire is set to cause hurt, disruption, annoyance, etc. then the purpose is wrongful and malicious.
Defendants who take property intending to return it are not guilty of a larceny at the time of the taking, but it becomes larceny (under the 'relation back' view) if the defendant later decides to keep the property. Some Courts held that lost property taken with intent to return it is held in 'constructive trust' so a subsequent keeping of the property was embezzlement. That was especially true if property was lost on a "common carrier" like a taxicab, train, or boat.]`,
		Sample5: `STATE v. YANG
1) LARCENY from the "Hot Tomato"?
Under criminal law LARCENY is the trespassory taking and carrying away of the personal property of another with an intent to permanently deprive. Modernly it is defined as THEFT.
Here Yang took and carried personal property of another because he "deftly lifted" the "wallet." Yang's intent to permanently deprive is implied by the facts.
This was a larceny but not a robbery because he did not use force or fear. Therefore, Yang can be charged with larceny.
2) ROBBERY of the Old Lady?
Under criminal law ROBBERY is a larceny, the trespassory taking and carrying away of the personal property of another, from the person by means of force or fear overcoming the will of the victim to resist.
Here Yang took and carried personal property of another because he "snatched a purse" and "rode away with the prize." Yang's intent to permanently deprive is implied by the facts.
This was a larceny from the person because the Old Lady was "holding tight" until she "lost her grip". And he used force to overcome the will of the victim to resist because he used force to break the Old Lady's "grip".
Therefore, Yang can be charged with robbery.
3) ATTEMPTED ROBBERY or ATTEMPTED LARCENY of the Chick?
Under criminal law an ATTEMPTED CRIME is a SUBSTANTIAL STEP toward committing a crime, with intent to commit the crime. Both LARCENY and ROBBER are defined above.
Here a SUBSTANTIAL STEP was taken toward LARCENY because Yang "reached out to snag another purse" and he clearly intended to take and carry away the purse to permanently deprive the Chick of it.
Therefore Yang can clearly be charged with ATTEMPTED LARCENY.
But there was also an IMPLIED INTENT that Yang intended to commit a larceny by force or fear because he had just previously robbed the "Old Lady" and that prior act showed he had no intention of letting go of the Chick's purse if she resisted his attempt to take it.
Therefore, Yang can be charged with ATTEMPTED ROBBERY and it would be up to the jury to decide if there was adequate evidence of intent to rob the Chick if she resisted his efforts to take her purse.

4) MISTAKE OF FACT as a defense to ATTEMPTED LARCENY or ROBBERY?
Under criminal law MISTAKE OF FACT is a defense that the defendant did not have the necessary intent because he either did not intend to commit the criminal act (GENERAL INTENT crimes) or to cause the criminal result (SPECIFIC INTENT crimes.)
Here Yang reached out to take a purse that did not exist. He clearly had an intent to commit a larceny or robbery. He might argue that the Chick did not have a purse so it would have been impossible for him to commit a crime. But ATTEMPT is a SPECIFIC INTENT crime so Yang would have to show he did not have any intent to cause a criminal result.
Since intent to cause a criminal result is shown, Yang could not use mistake of fact as an effective defense.
5) MISTAKE OF LAW as to the drugs?
Under criminal law a MISTAKE OF LAW about the legality of an intended act does not alter the legality of the attempted or committed act.
Here Yang attempted to buy a bag of "grass" that truly was grass. He intended to commit an illegal act because he thought the "grass" was illegal drugs. But he only took a substantial step toward an act that would have been a legal act, the act of buying lawn clippings. His criminal intent does not change that legal act he attempted to complete into an illegal act.
Therefore, Yang cannot be charged with an attempted purchase of illegal drugs.
[ANSWER EXPLANATION: This question raises the distinction between larceny from the person (pick pocket, purse snatcher) and robbery (larceny from person by fear or force.) It also raises the issues of mistake of fact. This is only a defense if it negates criminal intent. It is no defense just because the attempted crime is not feasible.
Mistake of law is also raised, and it can be very confusing. Remember this simple rule: The legality of an intended act does not alter the legality of the attempted or committed act. So focus on the act actually attempted or committed, and do not focus on the act intended.
For example, suppose jealous Boris Badanuf wants to kill Natahsa Nogudnik and takes the substantial step of driving to her house and shooting her body several times, but she has already died from a broken heart (Bullwinkle rejected her). Is it attempted murder or legal impossibility?
The answer is the crime of attempt is committed at the time of the substantial step. Always focus on that instant. If Natasha was alive at the instant Boris took that first substantial step (driving up to her home), then Boris is guilty of attempted murder at that instant. If Natasha was dead at the instant of the substantial step, she could not be killed at that moment or any time after that, so Boris' act (the substantial step) could not ever be a crime.]`,
		Sample6: `STATE v. KAREN
1) MURDER of Marvin?
Under criminal law MURDER is an unlawful homicide, the killing of one human being by another with malice aforethought. Malice for murder may be 1) express intent to kill, or implied by 2) intentionally causing great bodily injury, 3) intentionally committing an inherently dangerous felony, the FELONY-MURDER RULE, or 4) intentionally acting with an awareness of and conscious disregard for unreasonable risks to human life, the DEPRAVED HEART THEORY.
The felony-murder rule applies to deaths caused by acts done during the RES GESTAE of an inherently dangerous felony, the events beginning with the first substantial step toward commission of the crime and ending when the defendants leave the scene of the crime and reach a place of relative safety.
At common law there were no degrees of murder but modernly statutes define first degree murder as those that are 1) willful, deliberate and premeditated, 2) by enumerated means, or 3) caused by the commission of enumerated felonies. All other murders are in the second degree.
Here there was an unlawful homicide because Marvin was a human being and he was killed by Lucy, another human being. And it was caused by commission of an inherently dangerous felony, ROBBERY, a larceny from the person by force or fear. Karen was taking personal property of another with intent to permanently deprive because she was taking "dynamite" from Marvin, and she was using force or fear to overcome his will to resist because she used a "gun". The death of Marvin occurred within the RES GESTAE of the robbery because he was shot before she left the scene of the crime.
Therefore, Karen can be charged with murder for killing Marvin during the robbery. This would typically be FIRST DEGREE MURDER because robbery is typically one of the "enumerated felonies" for first degree murder.
2) MURDER of Ruby? MURDER is defined above.
There was an unlawful homicide because Ruby was a human being killed by Karen, another human being, without legal justification.
Here Karen appears to have acted with an express intent to kill because she shot Ruby in the "head" with a "gun". These facts imply an intent to kill. Alternatively, Karen clearly intended great bodily injury because the homicide was caused by a "firearm". Use of a firearm implies intent to cause serious bodily harm, regardless of where the victim is shot.
Karen also appears to have acted with an awareness and conscious disregard for danger to human life because she deliberately shot Ruby in the head for little good reason. Her act created extreme risks to Ruby, she apparently had an awareness of the risks and consciously disregarded them.
Based on any of the above theories, Karen could be charged with the murder of Ruby.
It appears Karen killed Ruby willfully and deliberately. If that is proven the murder was FIRST DEGREE. Karen might argue that she did not act willfully and deliberately to kill Ruby and only reacted instinctively because she had a "short fuse", a MITIGATING FACTOR that caused her to suffer from impaired capacity.
If Karen can convince the jury she acted instinctively and did not act willfully, deliberately and with premeditation the murder might be reduced to SECOND DEGREE.
3) ADEQUATE PROVOCATION for VOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER?
Under criminal law VOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER is an unlawful, intentional homicide without malice aforethought because of adequate provocation sufficient to raise a reasonable person to a fit of rage which could and actually did cause the homicide.
Generally "mere words alone" are not considered at law to be adequate provocation.
Here there was a lack of adequate provocation because "hard looks", being "dissed", challenged to a "spelling bee" and "criticisms of attire" are "mere words alone" that would not be sufficient to raise a reasonable person to a fit of murderous rage. The subjective factor that Karen "had a short fuse" would not lower the standard of conduct.
Therefore, Karen would not succeed in reducing the murder charge to voluntary manslaughter.
4) MURDER OF MARY? Murder is defined above.
Here there was a homicide because Mary was a human being killed by Karen, another human being. And Karen had an express intent to kill because she "decided to kill Mary". Further, this killing was willful, deliberate and premeditated because it was planned in advance.
Therefore, Karen can be charged with FIRST DEGREE murder of Mary and she has no defense.
5) MURDER OF BILL? Murder is defined above.
Here there was a homicide because Bill was a human being killed by Karen, another human being. Karen may have had an express intent to kill because she "knew the blast would probably kill Bill." But Karen would argue that she did not want to kill Bill because "she felt real bad about it." Regardless, Karen deliberately created extreme risks to human life with awareness of and conscious disregard because she "knew the blast would probably kill Bill."
Therefore, Karen could be charged with murder based on a Depraved Heart Theory of malice..
Further, this would generally be FIRST DEGREE murder because the use of explosives to murder is generally one of the "enumerated means" for first degree murder.
Therefore, Karen can probably be charged with FIRST DEGREE murder of Bill even if she did not willfully and deliberately cause his death with premeditation. She has no defenses.
[ANSWER EXPLANATION: This purpose of this question was to present four murders, each representing one of the four types of malice for murder. Marvin is a "felony-murder rule" situation, Ruby is a "great bodily injury" case, Mary is an "intent to kill" case, and Bill is a "depraved heart theory" case.
A second purpose of the question is to illustrate that "depraved heart murder" is not necessarily a "second degree" murder.
The question asks about "first degree" murder, and it is an express call. The call also asks about "lessor included offenses." That means manslaughter and NOT assault, battery, robbery, etc.
You must define and discuss robbery as a basis for the felony-murder rule application to some extent. A death caused by a robbery is almost always going to be first degree murder because virtually every State includes it as one of its "enumerated felonies".
Only one murder here presents any evidence of "provocation" or "mitigating factors".]`
