Frank also persuaded Martha to go to marital counseling with him on several occasions during the period of their separation.<br /><br />One night, Frank took Martha to dinner and she told him she thought the marriage was over and that she wanted to date someone that she had met. Frank returned her to their house and went back to his apartment. He drank a six-pack of beer. He called a close friend to discuss what Martha had said. The friend told him that Martha must not be taking his efforts at reconciliation seriously. Now drunk, Frank decided to drive over to the house to try once more to convince Martha that he was sincere.<br /><br />When he arrived at the home, he saw an automobile parked in the driveway. He did not recognize the car as one belonging to any of his wife’s friends. He parked his car around the corner and walked back to the house.<br /><br />Observing from the rear of the house, he saw his wife and a man eating dinner and drinking wine. He then saw them kiss.

                {
                    `Part A
I. State v. Frank
1. First-Degree Murder, Type A
The prosecutor could charge Frank with first-degree murder, under the first prong of the statute. Thus, the prosecutor must prove that the killing was willful, deliberate and premeditated. “Willful” in this context simply means a specific intent to kill. “Deliberate” in general implies that a person has weighed the reasons for and against the action and considered the consequences. “Premeditated” generally means that it was thought about beforehand. Jurisdictions have authorized the formation of premeditation in “the blink of an eye,” but others require enough time for a second look or reflection on the action before committing it. While there is no set formula for this determination, courts have provided a list of factors that could be taken into account in deciding whether a murder was premeditated, including previous ill-will between the parties, want of provocation, any statements of the defendant up to and during the crime, the brutality of the killing, the degree of planning and in the manner in which the killing was performed. In general, courts look to evidence of motive, planning activity and manner of killing.
The prosecution will point to several facts to support the charge. After Frank observed his wife and Kevin kissing, he let the air out of Kevin’s tires, went back to his house and retrieved a gun. The prosecution will argue that this shows that Frank was ensuring Kevin would not leave before he got back and that he was planning to kill Kevin. Then Frank spent an hour outside the house with a gun in his pants, aware that his wife was having an affair. He had plenty of time to weigh his options, cool off, and reflect, constituting premeditation and deliberation.
The defense will counter with the facts which show that Frank’s crime is the lesser crime of voluntary manslaughter (see below). Yet, the defense can also directly counter with the factors which do not support premeditation and deliberation. There was no previous ill-will between Frank and Kevin so there was no prior motive for Frank to kill Kevin before he heard Kevin and his wife having sex. Frank had made no previous statements about an intent to kill Kevin. Frank manifested a plan to stop Kevin from going until he could go back and take pictures, not a plan to kill. Frank only grabbed the gun as an afterthought. There was provocation which ultimately caused Frank to burst into the house and confront the couple, so there was no time for deliberation and premeditation. Frank shot Kevin just once, in the hip, clearly not trying to kill him. After shooting him in the hip, Frank then called the police and waited for assistance to arrive, which further evidences the fact that he had not planned to kill Kevin.
2. Second-Degree Murder
The prosecution could also charge Frank with second-degree murder, which is any killing committed recklessly under circumstances manifesting an extreme indifference to the value of human life. To be “reckless,” Frank must have been aware of and disregarded a substantial and unjustifiable risk of death. “Extreme indifference” to the value of human life is meant to capture a “depraved heart”, and it can be shown when there is a high probability of death or serious bodily injury occurring as a result of the conduct. There is no requirement of a specific intent to kill.
The prosecution will argue that Frank was reckless because he was aware of the risk of, at least, serious bodily injury when pointing a gun at a person and shooting. There is no indication Frank purposely shot at Kevin’s hip. To prove extreme indifference, the prosecution will say that any time you point a gun at someone and fire, as Frank did, there is a very high probability that death will occur.
The defense will counter by arguing that this is not the type of crime “extreme recklessness” murder was designed to capture, that Frank did not exhibit a depraved, or abandoned and malignant, heart or wanton disregard under the circumstances (see self-defense below). When Frank pointed the gun at Kevin’s hip and fired, he was not aware of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that Kevin would die. Also, the actions of calling for help for Kevin and waiting until help arrived show he did not have a depraved heart.
3. Voluntary Manslaughter: Type A
While the prosecution can charge voluntary manslaughter, it makes more sense for the defense to argue for voluntary manslaughter as the response to first-degree murder. The defense will argue that Frank committed voluntary manslaughter, type A, or “heat of passion” manslaughter. The defense would have to show that Frank was actually acting in a heat of passion, that it occurred upon adequate provocation under circumstances in which an average person would lose self-control, and that the heat of passion was sudden upon the provocation, so that there was no time to cool.
The defense will argue that Frank was subjectively in a heat of passion as evidenced by the fact that he burst into the room upon discovering that his wife was sleeping with another man. It was also sudden in that as soon as he heard his wife and Kevin having sex, he acted. Adultery is also classic adequate provocation, considered adequate at common law. An average man of average disposition in Frank’s shoes would be moved to a heat of passion upon discovering adultery.
If the defense raises voluntary manslaughter as a lesser charge to defend against first-degree murder, then the prosecution will counter with arguments that sound in first-degree murder, but also are specifically tailored to counter the claim of voluntary manslaughter. The prosecution will claim that there was no sudden heat of passion. The provocation occurred when Frank first saw his wife and Kevin kissing and he had more than adequate time to cool off and gain his self-control. He went back to his house and got a camera and a gun, evidencing that he understood that adultery was afoot, and then spent more time lying in wait outside the house.
4. Voluntary Manslaughter, Type B
The prosecution could argue that Frank committed the killing recklessly (Voluntary Manslaughter, Type B). To be “reckless,” Frank must have been aware of and disregarded a substantial and unjustifiable risk of death. “Extreme indifference” to the value of human life is meant to capture a “depraved heart”, and it can be shown when there is a high probability of death or serious bodily injury occurring as a result of the conduct. There is no requirement of a specific intent to kill.
The prosecution will argue that Frank was reckless because he was aware of the risk of, at least, serious bodily injury when pointing a gun at a person and shooting. There is no indication Frank purposely shot at Kevin’s hip. To prove extreme indifference, the prosecution will say that any time you point a gun at someone and fire, as Frank did, there is a very high probability that death will occur.
The defense will counter by arguing that this is not the type of crime “extreme recklessness” murder was designed to capture, that Frank did not exhibit a depraved, or abandoned and malignant, heart or wanton disregard under the circumstances (see self-defense below). When Frank pointed the gun at Kevin’s hip and fired, he was not aware of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that Kevin would die. Also, the actions of calling for help for Kevin and waiting until help arrived show he did not have a depraved heart.
5. Involuntary Manslaughter
To prove negligence, the prosecution would have to show that Frank, even if he was not actually aware of the risk, should have been aware of the substantial and unjustifiable risk that, upon firing the gun, Kevin could die or be seriously injured. In other words, the question is whether a reasonable person in Frank’s position would have been aware of the substantial and unjustifiable risk of death upon firing a gun at Kevin. The prosecution will argue that a reasonable person who fires a gun in a person’s direction would be aware of such a risk. The defense will argue (unpersuasively) that a reasonable person would not be aware that a person could die from a gunshot to the hip.
6. Affirmative Defense: Self-Defense
In response to any of the charges of homicide, Frank will argue that he acted in self-defense, which is an affirmative and complete defense to a charge of homicide. To prove self-defense, Frank must show that he reasonably and honestly believed: (1) there was a threat of the use of deadly force against him; (2) the threat was unlawful and immediate; (3) he was in imminent peril of death or serious bodily harm; and (4) his response was necessary to save himself.
The defense will argue that when Kevin, who was substantially larger than Frank, lunged at Frank, Frank honestly and reasonably believed that Kevin would cause him immediate serious bodily harm. Either Kevin would get the gun from his waistband and shoot him, or, at such a larger size, would beat him to a pulp. The prosecution will counter that a reasonable person would recognize that Kevin was reaching for the camera and was unaware of the presence of a gun. There was no threat of the use of deadly force, as Kevin was unarmed.
The prosecution might raise the issue of whether, even if the elements of self-defense were met, Frank had the duty to retreat. If this is a jurisdiction with a duty to retreat, then a person must retreat before using deadly force provided there is a safe manner for retreating. There is an exception in some jurisdictions if the person is in their own home. Here, if there was a duty to retreat, then Frank would have to leave before using deadly force, unless it was his home. The prosecution will argue he was living elsewhere at the time so this was not his home, while the defense will argue that it was still his home.
7. Affirmative Defense: Intoxication
Under the common law, intoxication is a defense only to specific intent crimes, and not general intent crimes. If, as a result of intoxication, the defendant did not form or was incapable of forming the specific intent, then he is not culpable. In many jurisdictions today, the defense is completely abolished. The Model Penal Code allows it as a defense if it negates the mens rea of the crime, unless the mens rea is recklessness, and then it is no defense if the reason the person was unaware of the risk was because of intoxication.
Here, under the common law, voluntary intoxication will only offer a defense to first-degree murder, the only specific intent crime discussed above. Frank will argue that after one six-pack of beer, he was too drunk to form the intent to kill, or premeditate or deliberate.
The prosecution will counter that Frank had the six-pack much earlier in the evening and then ingested only one more beer. Frank spent more than an hour in the backyard after that. He was certainly not too drunk at that point to form the intent to kill.
Part B
I. State v. Frank
1. Insanity Defense
Frank could argue that his mental imbalance constituted insanity, which would be a complete defense to any of the charged crimes. Under the Model Penal Code, a person is not responsible for his criminal conduct if, at the time of such conduct, as a result of mental disease or defect, he lacked the substantial capacity either to appreciate the criminality [wrongfulness] of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law. The former is a cognitive test and the latter is a volitional test. Frank’s particular condition seemed to affect his volitional impulses, as both his minimal brain dysfunction and the explosive personality disorder appear to cause him to explode in stressful situations. The defense will argue that this is exactly what happened when Frank heard his wife and Kevin having sex. One of the other tests for insanity which exists at common law is the “irresistible impulse” test, where a person acted solely as the result of an irresistible and uncontrollable impulse. The defense will argue that he suffered from such an impulse at the time.
The prosecution will counter that, under the volitional test of the Model Penal Code, or under the irresistible impulse test, Frank was not insane. While his conditions may result in some impulsive behavior, that particular night, Frank seemed in control of his actions. When he saw Kevin and his wife kissing, he went back to his house and got a camera and a gun. He then waited for an hour at the house before acting. He had the capacity to conform his conduct to the law, as, after he shot Kevin, he called the police and waited for their arrival.
Furthermore, his condition would not have fulfilled either the cognitive test of the Model Penal Code, or the other tests at common law. The other tests at common law include the M’Naghten test: where the defendant must demonstrate that he: (1) did not know the nature and quality of the act that he was doing; or, (2) if he did know, he did not know that what he was doing was wrong. Frank would not prevail since it clear that he understood that he shot at a human being and knew that it was wrong.`

            details: `Ally McNally is a lawyer in a small, quirky law firm, known for taking cases that no other law firm will touch. Ally, likewise, is a small, quirky woman who spends the bulk of her time unsuccessfully trying to have a love life. She has recently become smitten with a new lawyer named Luke Walker. It has not escaped Luke’s notice that for the past week, Ally has always managed to be right where he is — in the co-ed bathroom when he emerges from the stall, getting water from the water cooler, in a particular section of the library. Ally always says, “Oh, uh, well, uh, fancy meeting you here” and then she moves on. One day Ally gets up the nerve to ask Luke out on a date. Luke says “no thanks.” Ally goes home and looks in the mirror and tells herself she is “okay” and resolves to try again. The next day, Ally sends Luke a dozen roses with a note saying, “I’m a really good kisser. Ally.” Luke does not thank her for the flowers. Later that same day, Ally sees Luke talking to a secretary named Elaine. Ally realizes they are flirting and she becomes very upset. She e-mails Luke a message that simply says, “You are making a big mistake.”<br /><br />
That evening, Ally sees Luke leave the office and take the same elevator down as Elaine. Ally runs to catch the next elevator. As she gets off the elevator, she runs outside the building to see them walking away together. Ally follows them for about a block and a half, when Luke turns around and sees her. “Oh for God’s sake,” he moans. He then taps a police officer standing nearby on the shoulder and points at Ally, saying “That woman is following and harassing me.” Next thing she knows, she is in handcuffs and is arrested.<br /><br />
Ally is charged with stalking, which is defined as follows:<br /><br />
Stalking is an intentional and repeated following or<br /><br />
harassing of another person, when such following or<br /><br />
harassing seriously alarms, annoys or harasses the<br /><br />
person, and which serves no legitimate purpose.<br /><br />
A look into the legislative history of this “stalking statute” shows that it came about as a result of a concern over a couple of well-publicized cases. In one, a former husband repeatedly followed his former wife in a car, called her on the phone and threatened to do things to her, her current boyfriend, or her dog, slashed her tires twice, and hid outside her apartment. The police said there was little they could do when she called them. The former husband ultimately killed her. In another, a spurned co-worker followed the woman who rejected him every time she left the office until she got onto the subway, left her nasty notes at work, and finally was arrested for carrying an unlicensed weapon after she called the police, who found him waiting for her outside her house with a gun. The debate in the legislature showed that the legislative intent in passing the new statute was to get at the kind of behavior exhibited in these examples.<br /><br />
Webster’s New World Dictionary defines “alarm” as “to strike with fear: fill with anxiety,” and “annoy” as “to irritate with a nettling or exasperating effect.”<br /><br />
You represent Ally McNally. What possible defense or defenses might you have to the charge of stalking?`,

Ally will argue that the statute is vague (see argument below). The court must engage in the presumption that the statute is constitutional. If the court agrees that the terms are vague, then the court can look to statutory history and precedent to see whether there is a limiting interpretation of the statute. Here, statutory history shows that the legislature intended the kind of conduct involved in the two cases described both of which involved threats of violence which would strike fear into the reasonable person. Ally would argue to the court that, in order to save the statute, the court should adopt a limiting construction which includes that the activity involve a threat of violence, as well as that the activity be such that a reasonable person would recognize it as “annoying” or “harassing.” Ally would argue her conduct is not covered under such a limiting interpretation.
2. Void-for-Vagueness
Ally will argue that the statute is unconstitutionally vague. There are three claims of vagueness in this context. First, the terms employed are so vague as to leave the law-abiding person guessing as to what conduct is prohibited. For example, what “annoys”? The dictionary meaning provided  “to irritate with a nettling or exasperating effect” does not sufficiently define conduct to give the law-abiding citizen fair notice. And what is a “legitimate purpose”?
Second, the statute is overbroad in that it sweeps in innocent activity. It would seem to sweep in the moonstruck teenage boy as well as the serious stalker intended by the legislature.
Third, since the statute is so broadly worded and encompasses a wide range of activity, the statute leaves to the arresting officer too much discretion to enforce the law selectively.
3. Not Liable Under Statute
Even under the statute as written, Ally would argue that her conduct does not constitute stalking. She will argue that she only followed him once, as opposed to repeatedly. She will also argue that, to the extent she annoyed him, it was not “serious,” as indicated by his comment “Oh for God’s sake.” Finally, she will say her purpose in her conduct was legitimate to get the man out on a date.`

            details: `Mad Cap and June Bug are members of different rival gangs and both sell drugs. They hate each other and have gotten into fights before over being on the other’s home turf. Mad Cap has sworn to his gang members that the next time he sees June Bug on his turf, he is going to “put a cap in his ass” (shoot him dead).<br /><br />
One day, Mad Cap encounters June Bug in Mad Cap’s neighborhood. Both, as usual, are packing guns. Mad Cap goes to pass June Bug without saying anything, but intentionally bumps him on his way past him. June Bug turns around and says, “What’s up?”, known in gang lingo to signify, “Do you want to fight?” Mad Cap says, “You are what’s up” and pulls his gun out of his pocket. June Bug laughs and says, “You expect that to scare me? You can’t even keep your own mama off drugs.” Mad Cap’s mother is a heroin addict and everyone in the neighborhood knows it. Mad Cap is terribly ashamed of this fact and very sensitive to people’s comments about it. He flies into a rage and shoots June Bug, hitting him in the abdomen. Mad Cap runs and leaves June Bug lying in the street. Unattended, a wound of that type would cause June Bug’s death within twenty-four hours.<br /><br />
An ambulance takes June Bug to the hospital emergency room, where Dr. Green is assigned to take care of him. (Dr. Green hates gang bangers and is constantly doing unethical things in the E.R. to show he is a righteous member of society.) Dr. Green makes all conventional efforts to save June Bug but June Bug is not responding to treatment. Dr. Green is aware of a new procedure that is expensive, time-consuming and still in the experimental stages. It has a 65% chance of working on June Bug. Nonetheless, Dr. Green decides not to do the procedure. June Bug dies on the operating table.<br /><br />
What charge charges will the prosecutor consider bringing against Mad Cap and Dr. Green? As far as Mad Cap, consider only two charges which seem to you to most likely fit his deed. For both Mad Cap and Dr. Green, analyze the charges from both a prosecutorial and defense perspective.`,
            toRemember: `For This QUESTION, refer to the following list of state statutes for all substantive crimes. For criminal law defenses, however, refer to your own knowledge under both the common law and the Model Penal Code.
FIRST-DEGREE MURDER:
(A) A homicide perpetrated by any kind of willful, deliberate and premeditated killing; or

(B) a killing proximately caused in the perpetration of, or attempt to perpetrate, a felony.


SECOND-DEGREE MURDER:
Any murder which is committed recklessly under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life.
VOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER:
(A) A homicide that would otherwise be murder is committed in a sudden passion or heat of blood caused by provocation sufficient to deprive an average person of his self-control and cool reflection; or
(B) a homicide committed recklessly.
INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER:
A homicide committed negligently.
SIMPLE BURGLARY:
The unauthorized entering of any dwelling, vehicle, watercraft, or other structure, movable or unmovable, with the intent to commit a felony or any theft therein. Whoever commits the crime of simple burglary is guilty of a felony.
THEFT:
The taking of anything of value which belongs to another, without the consent of the other to the taking, with the intent to deprive the other permanently of the subject of the taking. Whoever commits the crime of theft is guilty of a felony.
ATTEMPT:

                    `I. State v. Mad Cap
1. First-Degree Murder, Type A
The prosecutor will charge Mad Cap with first-degree murder, under the first prong of the statute. Thus, the prosecutor must prove that the killing was willful, deliberate and premeditated. While there is no set formula for this determination, courts have provided a list of factors that could be taken into account in deciding whether a murder was premeditated, including previous ill-will between the parties, want of provocation, any statements of the defendant up to and during the crime, the brutality of the killing, the degree of planning and in the manner in which the killing was performed. Jurisdictions have authorized the formation of premeditation in “the blink of an eye,” but others require enough time for a second look or reflection on the action before committing it.
The prosecution will point to the fact that there was ill will between the parties giving Mad Cap a motive to kill June Bug, that June Bug did not provoke him (other than through some words), that Mad Cap had said that the next time he saw June Bug on his turf he was going to kill him, and that he shot June Bug in the abdomen, leaving him there to die. To counter any claim of provocation on the part of June Bug (see below), the prosecution will point out that Mad Cap had his gun out and was ready to shoot before June Bug said anything about his mother.
The defense will counter the charge of first-degree murder with an argument that supports a charge of voluntary “heat of passion” manslaughter. The defense would argue that Mad Cap was actually acting in a heat of passion (he flew into a rage), that it was sudden upon the provocation (no cooling period), and that it occurred upon adequate provocation (under circumstances in which an average person would act similarly). The provocation was that June Bug said that “You can’t even keep your own mama off drugs,” knowing that Mad Cap’s mother was a heroin addict and he was very sensitive about it. In some jurisdictions, words alone are not enough to constitute adequate provocation. Even if they are, the uphill battle for the defense would be to show that the average person would lose self-control. For the average person, it is unlikely that an insult to one’s mother about a vulnerable characteristic would cause the person to fly into a homicidal rage.
2. Causation
This question raises a causation issue. The issue is whether Dr. Green’s actions were an intervening cause sufficient to break the chain of causation between Mad Cap’s shooting and June Bug’s death. If Dr. Green had performed the experimental procedure, there was a 65% chance that June Bug would have lived. Given that only by Dr. Green’s intervention could June Bug have lived at all, even if Dr. Green were negligent or accelerated June Bug’s death, neither affect the underlying liability of Mad Cap. The courts usually employ the following test for proximate cause, which is a test for foreseeability: if the intervening act was a coincidence (putting the victim at a certain place at a certain time, making it possible for him to be acted upon by the intervening cause), then the chain of causation will not be broken if it was foreseeable; and if the intervening act was a response to the defendant’s actions (a reaction to the conditions created by the defendant), then the chain of causation is only broken if the response was abnormal. Dr. Green’s intervention was a response, and his decision to forego the experimental treatment was certainly not abnormal. Hence, Dr. Green’s omission did not break the chain of causation.
II. State v. Dr. Green
1. Causation
First, no matter what Dr. Green is charged with, are his actions a direct (“but for”) cause of June Bug’s death? But for the abandonment of the procedure, there was a 65% chance June Bug would have lived. It is questionable whether a percentage is enough to constitute a “but for” cause.
2. Actus Reus
Dr. Green did not perform an act, but an omission. He withheld care. He can be liable for an omission only if he had a duty to act. The prosecution will argue that as a doctor, he has a duty to his patient to save his life at all costs. If he knew of a treatment that gave June Bug a 65% chance of living, he should have performed it, regardless of how experimental or expensive it was. The defense will counter that a physician only has a duty to give what is necessary and proportionate and cannot be deemed to have a duty to go above and beyond ordinary care. If he is found not to have a duty, then he is not guilty of any crime.
3. Second-Degree Murder
Assuming the prosecution jumps the hurdles of causation and actus reus, the prosecution could charge Dr. Green with second-degree murder, which is any murder committed recklessly under circumstances manifesting an extreme indifference to the value of human life. To be “reckless,” Dr. Green must have been aware of and disregarded a substantial and unjustifiable risk of death. “Extreme indifference” can be shown when there is a high probability of death occurring as a result of the conduct.
The risk of death was 100% by foregoing the procedure, so there was clearly a substantial risk of death. Was it an unjustifiable risk? That would depend upon whether one agreed with the assessment of the doctor that, because it was experimental, expensive and no guarantee, that it was not worth doing. As far as whether the risk was extreme, while Dr. Green would seem to know his omission would cause death, the question is whether he had an “abandoned and malignant heart” in foregoing the procedure. The prosecution will argue it was a heartless choice and the defense will argue it was not.
4. Voluntary Manslaughter, Part B
This charge requires recklessness. To be “reckless,” Dr. Green must have been aware of and disregarded a substantial and unjustifiable risk of death. “Extreme indifference” can be shown when there is a high probability of death occurring as a result of the conduct.
The risk of death was 100% by foregoing the procedure, so there was clearly a substantial risk of death. Was it an unjustifiable risk? That would depend upon whether one agreed with the assessment of the doctor that, because it was experimental, expensive and no guarantee, that it was not worth doing. As far as whether the risk was extreme, while Dr. Green would seem to know his omission would cause death, the question is whether he had an “abandoned and malignant heart” in foregoing the procedure. The prosecution will argue it was a heartless choice and the defense will argue it was not.
5. Involuntary Manslaughter
The prosecution will argue that Dr. Green was negligent in that a reasonable person in his shoes would have been aware of the substantial and justifiable risk of death. Of course, the risk was 100%, and the question simply becomes whether it was justifiable, as described above. Another way to state the issue in this particular case is whether Dr. Green exhibited the reasonable care of a doctor in his situation, and the same issues again arise.

            details: `Winston and Charlene have been married for less than a year. Winston is about 5’9” tall and 155 pounds and Charlene is 5’10” tall and 145 pounds. Winston often (several times a week) starts fights with Charlene, getting angry at her and then slapping or hitting her. Although he has caused some black eyes and red marks, Winston has never caused serious bodily injury to Charlene. The fights often occur after Charlene has returned from being out somewhere, because Winston becomes convinced she has been cheating on him every time she goes out.<br /><br />
Winston has been to therapy in the past about his anger and was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder, which is described in DSM IV as follows:<br /><br />
A pervasive pattern of instability in interpersonal relationships, self-image, and affects, and marked impulsivity beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts, as indicated by five (or more) of the following:<br /><br />

(1) frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment<br />
(2) a pattern of unstable and intense interpersonal relationships characterized by alternating between extremes of idealization and devaluation<br />
(3) markedly or persistently unstable self-image or sense of self<br />
(4) chronic feelings of emptiness<br />
(5) inappropriate, intense anger or difficulty controlling anger<br />
(6) impulsivity in at least two areas that are potentially self-damaging (e.g., spending, sex, substance abuse, reckless driving, binge eating)<br />
(7) transient, stress-related paranoia<br />
(8) instability due to a marked reactivity of mood (intense depression, irritability, or anxiety usually lasting a few hours and only rarely more than a few days).<br /><br />

One day, Charlene returns home from shopping and Winston is fuming. He accuses her of having been out with a man. She tries to ignore him and walks into the bedroom. Winston follows her into the bedroom, screaming at her. He comes after her with his fists clenched and his face red. He slaps her hard and she falls against the wall of the bedroom. Charlene grabs for a gun that Winston keeps on the nightstand, points the gun at him and fires a shot which misses him by an inch. They struggle over the gun. Winston grabs her hand that has the gun with one of his hands and at the same time, with his other hand, grabs one of his fifteen-pound bar bells off of the floor and hits her over the head with it. Charlene dies an hour later at the hospital from the hemorrhaging of the head injury.<br /><br />
Assume the prosecutor charges Winston with heat of passion voluntary manslaughter, and only that. You are the defense attorney. Assume you think the prosecutor can meet all of the elements of heat of passion manslaughter, what other defense or defenses does Winston have? What will be the prosecution’s response?`,

                    `I. State v. Winston
1. Insanity
Winston could argue that his condition, Borderline Personality Disorder, was a mental disease or defect that rendered him insane at the time of the killing. Courts rarely define the term “mental disease or defect” so this will be open to interpretation by experts. If Winston is able to show that Borderline Personality Disorder is a mental disease or defect, then he will argue he was insane under one of the following tests. Many states have adopted the Model Penal Code test: a person is not responsible for criminal conduct if at the time of such conduct as a result of mental disease or defect he lacks substantial capacity either to appreciate the criminality [wrongfulness] of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law. This test involves both a cognitive and a volitional component. Some of the characteristics of Borderline Personality Disorder seem to involve volition — difficulty controlling anger and impulsivity in areas that are potentially self-damaging. Winston could argue that he lost control over his impulses when he hit her with the bar bell. His frantic efforts to avoid abandonment and his paranoia led to his reaction. He would also argue that his condition fits the another common law test, the “irresistible impulse” test, where the person acted from an irresistible and uncontrollable impulse. The defense will argue that he suffered from such an impulse at the time.
The other tests at common law include the M’Naghten test: where the defendant must demonstrate that he: (1) did not know the nature and quality of the act that he was doing; or, (2) if he did know, he did not know that what he was doing was wrong. This is a purely cognitive test and one under which Winston is unlikely to prevail since there is no indication in his diagnosis that he would not know right from wrong.
The prosecution will respond that frantic efforts to avoid abandonment plus difficulty controlling anger does not make a mental disease or defect sufficient to raise the flag of insanity. There is no indication that he lacked substantial capacity to conform his conduct to the law as he lived a normal life on a daily basis and did not normally lose control like this.
2. Self-Defense
Winston will argue he was acting in self-defense. At common law, a non-aggressor is justified in using deadly force in self-protection if the actor reasonably believes that its use is necessary to prevent imminent and unlawful use of deadly force by the aggressor. “Deadly force” is force intended or likely to cause death or grievous bodily injury.
Winston’s argument will be that Charlene had just employed deadly force on him — she fired a round at him and missed. He was trying to prevent her from shooting him again when he hit her over the head with the bar bell. He was therefore reasonable in his belief that deadly force was imminent and that he needed to use deadly force in response.
The prosecution will have several counterarguments. First, Winston was the first aggressor and hence lost his right of self defense. The question here turns upon whether Winston was a deadly aggressor or a non-deadly aggressor. He slapped her hard and she fell against the wall of the bedroom. The prosecution will argue that this is deadly force — enough to cause serious bodily injury to a woman. If the prosecution prevails, then the only way that Winston could have regained his right of self-defense was by withdrawing from the conflict and successfully communicating this fact. If he was a non-deadly aggressor instead, and then Charlene responded with deadly force, there are two possibilities. Some courts hold that once she responded with deadly force, he immediately regained his right to self-defense. Other courts hold that he is not entitled to use deadly force unless he retreats, if safe retreat is available. If he does, or if there is no safe retreat, then he may use deadly force. Because one cannot retreat safely from a loaded gun, if Winston is a non-deadly aggressor, then he would regain his right of self-defense. This latter point also goes to any duty to retreat. If there is a jurisdiction with a duty to retreat, and there is no exception for a man’s home, then Winston still would not have to retreat since he could not do so safely with an uplifted gun.
The prosecution will also argue that at the point at which Winston hit Charlene over the head with a bar bell, he had grabbed her hand with the gun. At that moment, then, there was no imminent threat of deadly force.
Finally, the prosecution will argue that Winston could not avail himself of self-defense because he was not defending himself against an unlawful use of force. Winston had just hit Charlene, and Charlene may have had a right to use deadly force at that point. The prosecution will argue that she believed that seriously bodily injury was imminent because he had slapped or hit her before. The prosecution might employ the battered woman’s syndrome to explain how women in her position reasonably feel that grievous bodily injury is imminent. If the prosecution is successful, then Winston had no right to self-defense. However, in some jurisdictions, he might have an “imperfect” right of self-defense if he was unreasonable but honest in his belief that deadly force was necessary`
